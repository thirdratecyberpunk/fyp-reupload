Whan seyd was al this miracle, every man
When all this miracle was told, every man
As sobre was that wonder was to se,
Was so sober that it was wonderful to see,
Til that oure Hooste japen tho bigan,
Until our Host then began to joke
And thanne at erst he looked upon me,
And then for the first time he looked at me,
And seyde thus: "What man artow?" quod he;
And said thus: "What sort of man art thou?" said he;
"Thou lookest as thou woldest fynde an hare,
"Thou lookest as if thou would track a hare,
For evere upon the ground I se thee stare.
For ever upon the ground I see thee stare.
"Approche neer, and looke up murily.
" Approach nearer, and look up merrily.
Now war yow, sires, and lat this man have place!
Now make way, sirs, and let this man have room!
He in the waast is shape as wel as I;
He in the waist is shaped as well as I;
This were a popet in an arm t' enbrace
This would be a little doll in an arm to embrace
For any womman, small and fair of face.
For any woman, small and fair of face.
He semeth elvyssh by his contenaunce,
He seems otherworldly in his behavior,
For unto no wight dooth he daliaunce.
For unto no person is he sociable:
"Sey now somwhat, syn oother folk han sayd;
"Say something now, since other folk have spoken;
Telle us a tale of myrthe, and that anon."
Tell us a tale of mirth, and that right now."
"Hooste," quod I, "ne beth nat yvele apayd,
"Host," said I, "be not displeased,
For oother tale certes kan I noon,
For certainly I know no other tale,
But of a rym I lerned longe agoon."
Except for a riming romance I learned long ago."
"Ye, that is good," quod he; "now shul we heere
"Yes, that is good," said he; "now we shall hear
Som deyntee thyng, me thynketh by his cheere."
Some dainty thing, it seems to me from his appearance."
Heere bigynneth Chaucers Tale of Thopas.
Here begins Chaucer's Tale of Thopas.
Listeth, lordes, in good entent,
Listen, my lords, with good will,
And I wol telle verrayment
And I will tell truly
Of myrthe and of solas,
Of mirth and of pleasure,
Al of a knyght was fair and gent
All about a knight who was fair and gentle
In bataille and in tourneyment;
In battle and in tournament;
His name was sire Thopas.
His name was sir Thopas.
Yborn he was in fer contree,
He was born in a distant land,
In Flaundres, al biyonde the see,
In Flanders, far beyond the sea,
At Poperyng, in the place.
At Popering, in that place.
His fader was a man ful free,
His father was a very noble man,
And lord he was of that contree,
And he was lord of that country,
As it was Goddes grace.
Since it was God's will.
Sire Thopas wax a doghty swayn;
Sir Thopas grew up to be a doughty lad;
Whit was his face as payndemayn,
White was his face as fine white bread,
His lippes rede as rose;
His lips red as a rose;
His rode is lyk scarlet in grayn,
His complexion is like scarlet deeply dyed,
And I yow telle in good certayn
And I tell you in true certainty
He hadde a semely nose.
He had a seemly nose.
His heer, his berd was lyk saffroun,
His hair, his beard was like saffron,
That to his girdel raughte adoun;
That to his girdle reached down;
His shoon of cordewane.
His shoes of Cordovan leather.
Of Brugges were his hosen broun,
Of Bruges were his brown stockings,
His robe was of syklatoun,
His robe was of silk woven with gold,
That coste many a jane.
That cost many a half-penny.
He koude hunte at wilde deer,
He knew how to hunt for wild animals,
And ride an haukyng for river
And ride a-hawking for water-fowl
With grey goshauk on honde;
With grey gos-hawk on hand;
Therto he was a good archeer;
Moreover he was a good archer;
Of wrastlyng was ther noon his peer,
In wrestling there was no one his peer,
Ther any ram shal stonde.
Where any ram shall stand (as a prize).
Ful many a mayde, bright in bour,
Very many a maid, bright in bed-chamber,
They moorne for hym paramour,
They mourn for him passionately,
Whan hem were bet to slepe;
When it would be better for them to sleep;
But he was chaast and no lechour,
But he was chaste and no lecher,
And sweete as is the brembul flour
And sweet as is the dog rose
That bereth the rede hepe.
That bears the red hip.
And so bifel upon a day,
And it so happened upon a day,
For sothe, as I yow telle may,
In truth, as I can tell you,
Sire Thopas wolde out ride.
Sir Thopas wanted to ride out.
He worth upon his steede gray,
He mounted upon his gray steed,
And in his hand a launcegay,
And in his hand a light lance,
A long swerd by his side.
A long sword by his side.
He priketh thurgh a fair forest,
He spurs through a fair forest,
Therinne is many a wilde best,
In which is many a wild best,
Ye, bothe bukke and hare;
Yea, both buck and hare;
And as he priketh north and est,
And as he spurs north and east,
I telle it yow, hym hadde almest
I tell it you, to him had almost
Bitid a sory care.
Happened a grievous misfortune.
Ther spryngen herbes grete and smale,
There spring herbs large and small,
The lycorys and the cetewale,
The licorice and the zedoary,
And many a clowe-gylofre;
And many a clove-gillyflower;
And notemuge to putte in ale,
And nutmeg to put in ale,
Wheither it be moyste or stale,
Whether it be new or old,
Or for to leye in cofre.
Or to lay in a clothes press.
The briddes synge, it is no nay,
The birds sing, it can not be denied,
The sparhauk and the papejay,
The sparrow hawk and the parrot,
That joye it was to heere;
That it was joy to hear;
The thrustelcok made eek hir lay,
The male thrush made also her lay,
The wodedowve upon the spray
The wood-pigeon upon the branch
She sang ful loude and cleere.
She sang very loud and clear.
Sire Thopas fil in love-longynge,
Sir Thopas fell in a yearning for love,
Al whan he herde the thrustel synge,
As soon as he heard the thrush sing,
And pryked as he were wood.
And spurred as if he were crazy.
His faire steede in his prikynge
His fair steed in his spurring
So swatte that men myghte him wrynge;
So sweated that one could wring him;
His sydes were al blood.
His sides were all blood.
Sire Thopas eek so wery was
Sir Thopas also so weary was
For prikyng on the softe gras,
For spurring on the soft grass,
So fiers was his corage,
So fierce was his heart,
That doun he leyde him in that plas
That down he laid him in that place
To make his steede som solas,
To give his steed some rest,
And yaf hym good forage.
And gave him good dry fodder.
"O Seinte Marie, benedicite!
"O Saint Mary, bless me!
What eyleth this love at me
What does this love have against me
To bynde me so soore?
To bind me so painfully?
Me dremed al this nyght, pardee,
I dreamed all this night, by God,
An elf-queene shal my lemman be
An elf-queen shall be my sweetheart
And slepe under my goore.
And sleep under my cloak.
"An elf-queene wol I love, ywis,
"An elf-queen will I love, indeed,
For in this world no womman is
For in this world no woman is
Worthy to be my make
Worthy to be my mate
In towne;
In town;
Alle othere wommen I forsake,
All other women I forsake,
And to an elf-queene I me take
And to an elf-queen I betake nyself,
By dale and eek by downe!"
By dale and also by hill!"
Into his sadel he clamb anon,
Into his saddle he climbed at once,
And priketh over stile and stoon
And spurs over stile and stone
An elf-queene for t' espye,
An elf-queen for to see,
Til he so longe hath riden and goon
Until he so long had ridden and walked
That he foond, in a pryve woon,
That he found, in a secret place,
The contree of Fairye
The country of Fairy
So wilde;
So wild;
For in that contree was ther noon
For in that country there was no one
That to him durste ride or goon,
Who dared ride or go on foot at him,
Neither wyf ne childe;
Neither woman nor child;
Til that ther cam a greet geaunt,
Until there came a big giant,
His name was sire Olifaunt,
His name was sir Olifaunt,
A perilous man of dede.
A perilous man of deeds.
He seyde, "Child, by Termagaunt,
He said, "Child, by Termagaunt,
But if thou prike out of myn haunt,
Unless thou spur out of my territory,
Anon I sle thy steede
At once I will slay thy steed
With mace.
With mace.
Heere is the queene of Fayerye,
Here is the queen of Fairyland,
With harpe and pipe and symphonye,
With harp and pipe and hurdy-gurdy,
Dwellynge in this place."
Dwelling in this place."
The child seyde, "Also moote I thee,
The child said, "As I may prosper,
Tomorwe wol I meete with thee,
Tomorrow will I meet with thee,
Whan I have myn armoure;
When I have my armor;
And yet I hope, par ma fay,
And yet I trust, by my faith,
That thou shalt with this launcegay
That thou shalt by means of this light lance
Abyen it ful sowre.
Very bitterly pay for it.
Thy mawe
Thy maw
Shal I percen, if I may,
Shall I pierce, if I can,
Er it be fully pryme of day,
Ere it be fully prime of day ( a.m.),
For heere thow shalt be slawe."
For here thou shalt be slain."
Sire Thopas drow abak ful faste;
Sir Thopas drew back very fast;
This geant at hym stones caste
This giant threw stones at him
Out of a fel staf-slynge.
Out of a terrible staff-sling.
But faire escapeth child Thopas,
But child Thopas safely escapes,
And al it was thurgh Goddes gras,
And it was all due to God's grace,
And thurgh his fair berynge.
And due to his fair bearing.
Yet listeth, lordes, to my tale
Yet listen, gentlemen, to my tale
Murier than the nightyngale,
Merrier than the nightingale,
For now I wol yow rowne
For now I will you tell
How sir Thopas, with sydes smale,
How sir Thopas, with slender waist,
Prikyng over hill and dale,
Spurring over hill and dale,
Is comen agayn to towne.
Is come again to town.
His myrie men comanded he
His merry men commanded he
To make hym bothe game and glee,
To make him both amusement and delight,
For nedes moste he fighte
For by necessity he must fight
With a geaunt with hevedes three,
With a giant with three heads,
For paramour and jolitee
For love and pleasure
Of oon that shoon ful brighte.
Of one who shone very bright.
"Do come," he seyde, "my mynstrales,
"Do come," he said, "my musicians,
And geestours for to tellen tales,
And story tellers to tell tales,
Anon in myn armynge,
Right now in my arming,
Of romances that been roiales,
Of romances that are royal,
Of popes and of cardinales,
Of popes and of cardinals,
And eek of love-likynge."
And also of the joys of love."
They fette hym first the sweete wyn,
They fetched him first the sweet wine,
And mede eek in a mazelyn,
And mead also in a maple drinking bowl,
And roial spicerye
And royal delicacies
Of gyngebreed that was ful fyn,
Of gingerbread that was very fine,
And lycorys, and eek comyn,
And licorice, and also cumin,
With sugre that is trye.
With sugar that is excellent.
He dide next his white leere
He put on next to his white flesh
Of cloth of lake fyn and cleere,
Of linen cloth fine and clear,
A breech and eek a sherte;
A pair of trousers and also a shirt;
And next his sherte an aketoun,
And next to his shirt a quilted jacket,
And over that an haubergeoun
And over that a chain-mail shirt
For percynge of his herte;
To prevent piercing of his heart;
And over that a fyn hawberk,
And over that a fine plate armor,
Was al ywroght of Jewes werk,
Which was all wrought with jewelers' work,
Ful strong it was of plate;
Very strong it was of iron plate;
And over that his cote-armour
And over that his surcoat
As whit as is a lilye flour,
As white as is a lily flour,
In which he wol debate.
In which he will dispute.
His sheeld was al of gold so reed,
His shield was all of gold so red,
And therinne was a bores heed,
And on that was a boar's head,
A charbocle bisyde;
Beside a carbuncle (red gem);
And there he swoor on ale and breed
And there he swore on ale and bread
How that the geaunt shal be deed,
How the giant shall be dead,
Bityde what bityde!
Whatever may happen!
His jambeux were of quyrboilly,
His leg guards were of hardened leather,
His swerdes shethe of yvory,
His sword's sheath of ivory,
His helm of latoun bright;
His helm of bright brass;
His sadel was of rewel boon,
His saddle was of ivory,
His brydel as the sonne shoon,
His bridle shone like the sun,
Or as the moone light.
Or like the moon light.
His spere was of fyn ciprees,
His spear was of fine cypress,
That bodeth werre, and nothyng pees,
That foretells war, and nothing of peace,
The heed ful sharpe ygrounde;
The head ground very sharp;
His steede was al dappull gray,
His steed was all dapple gray,
It gooth an ambil in the way
It goes at a slow walk on the way
Ful softely and rounde
Very softly and easily
In londe.
In land.
Loo, lordes myne, heere is a fit!
Lo, my lords, here is a fit!
If ye wol any moore of it,
If you want to hear any more of it,
To telle it wol I fonde.
To tell it will I try
Now holde youre mouth, par charitee,
Now hold your mouth, for kindness, please,
Bothe knyght and lady free,
Both knight and noble lady,
And herkneth to my spelle;
And hearken to my tale;
Of bataille and of chivalry,
Of battle and of chivalry,
And of ladyes love-drury
And of ladies' passionate love
Anon I wol yow telle.
Right now I will you tell.
Men speken of romances of prys,
Men speak of excellent romances,
Of Horn child and of Ypotys,
Of Horn child and of Ypotys,
Of Beves and sir Gy,
Of Bevis of Hampton and sir Guy of Watwick,
Of sir Lybeux and Pleyndamour --
Of sir Lybeux Desconus and Pleyndamour --
But sir Thopas, he bereth the flour
But sir Thopas, he bears the flower
Of roial chivalry!
Of royal chivalry!
His goode steede al he bistrood,
His good steed he mounted
And forth upon his wey he glood
And forth upon his way he glided
As sparcle out of the bronde;
Like a spark out of the burning log;
Upon his creest he bar a tour,
Upon his top of his helmet he bore a tower,
And therinne stiked a lilie flour --
And in that stuck a lily flower --
God shilde his cors fro shonde!
God protect his body from shame!
And for he was a knyght auntrous,
And because he was a knight errent,
He nolde slepen in noon hous,
He would not sleep in any house,
But liggen in his hoode;
But lie in his hood;
His brighte helm was his wonger,
His bright helm was his pillow,
And by hym baiteth his dextrer
And by him his war-horse grazes
Of herbes fyne and goode.
On herbs fine and good.
Hymself drank water of the well,
He himself drank water of the well,
As dide the knyght sire Percyvell
As did the knight sir Perceval
So worly under wede,
So worthy in his armor,
Til on a day --
Until on a day --
"Namoore of this, for Goddes dignitee,"
"No more of this, for God's dignity,"
Quod oure Hooste, "for thou makest me
Said our Host, "for thou makest me
So wery of thy verray lewednesse
So weary of thy true ignorance
That, also wisly God my soule blesse,
That, as surely as God may bless my soul,
Myne eres aken of thy drasty speche.
My ears ache from thy crappy speech.
Now swich a rym the devel I biteche!
Now such a rime I commit to the devil!
This may wel be rym dogerel," quod he.
This may well be doggerel verse," said he.
"Why so?" quod I, "why wiltow lette me
"Why so?" said I, "why wilt thou prevent me
Moore of my tale than another man,
From telling more of my tale than another man,
Syn that it is the beste rym I kan?"
Since it is the best rime I know?"
"By God," quod he, "for pleynly, at a word,
"By God," said he, "for plainly, at one word,
Thy drasty rymyng is nat worth a toord!
Thy crappy riming is not worth a turd!
Thou doost noght elles but despendest tyme.
Thou dost nothing else but waste time.
Sire, at o word, thou shalt no lenger ryme.
Sir, at one word, thou shalt no longer rime.
Lat se wher thou kanst tellen aught in geeste,
Let's see whether thou can tell anything in alliterative verse,
Or telle in prose somwhat, at the leeste,
Or tell something in prose, at the least,
In which ther be som murthe or som doctryne."
In which there may be some mirth or some doctrine."
"Gladly," quod I, "by Goddes sweete pyne!
"Gladly," said I, "by God's sweet pain!
I wol yow telle a litel thyng in prose
I will you tell a little thing in prose
That oghte liken yow, as I suppose,
That ought to please you, as I suppose,
Or elles, certes, ye been to daungerous.
Or else, certainly, you are too hard to please.
It is a moral tale vertuous,
It is a virtuous moral tale,
Al be it told somtyme in sondry wyse
Although it is told sometimes in various ways
Of sondry folk, as I shal yow devyse.
By various folk, as I shall tell you.
"As thus: ye woot that every Evaungelist
"As thus: you know that every Evangelist
That telleth us the peyne of Jhesu Crist
Who tells us of the pain of Jesus Christ
Ne seith nat alle thyng as his felawe dooth;
Does not say everything as his fellow does;
But nathelees hir sentence is al sooth,
But nonetheless their essential meaning is all true,
And alle acorden as in hire sentence,
And all agree in their meaning,
Al be ther in hir tellyng difference.
Although there may be a difference in their telling.
For somme of hem seyn moore, and somme seyn lesse,
For some of them say more, and some say less,
Whan they his pitous passioun expresse --
When they His piteous passion express --

I mean of Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John --
But doutelees hir sentence is al oon.
But doubtless their essential meaning is all the same.
Therfore, lordynges alle, I yow biseche,
Therefore, gentlemen, I beseech you,
If that yow thynke I varie as in my speche,
If you think I vary as in my speech,
As thus, though that I telle somwhat moore
As thus, though I tell something more
Of proverbes than ye han herd bifoore
Of proverbs than you have heard before
Comprehended in this litel tretys heere,
Comprehended in this little treatise here,
To enforce with th' effect of my mateere;
With which to strengthen the effect of my matter;
And though I nat the same wordes seye
And though I do not say the same words
As ye han herd, yet to yow alle I preye
As you have heard, yet to you all I pray
Blameth me nat; for, as in my sentence,
Blame not me; for, in my essential meaning,
Shul ye nowher fynden difference
You shall nowhere find difference
Fro the sentence of this tretys lyte
From the meaning of that little treatise
After the which this murye tale I write.
In imitation of which this merry tale I write.
And therfore herkneth what that I shal seye,
And therefore hearken what I shall say,
And lat me tellen al my tale, I preye."
And let me tell all my tale, I pray."
