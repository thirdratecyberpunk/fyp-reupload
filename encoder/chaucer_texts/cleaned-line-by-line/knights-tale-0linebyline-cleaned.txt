Whilom, as olde stories tellen us,
Once, as old histories tell us,
Ther was a duc that highte Theseus;
There was a duke who was called Theseus;
Of Atthenes he was lord and governour,
He was lord and governor of Athens,
And in his tyme swich a conquerour
And in his time such a conqueror
That gretter was ther noon under the sonne.
That there was no one greater under the sun.
Ful many a riche contree hadde he wonne;
Very many a powerful country had he won;
What with his wysdom and his chivalrie,
What with his wisdom and his chivalry,
He conquered al the regne of Femenye,
He conquered all the land of the Amazons,
That whilom was ycleped Scithia,
That once was called Scithia,
And weddede the queene Ypolita,
And wedded the queen Ypolita,
And broghte hire hoom with hym in his contree
And brought her home with him into his country
With muchel glorie and greet solempnytee,
With much glory and great ceremony,
And eek hir yonge suster Emelye.
And also her young sister Emelye.
And thus with victorie and with melodye
And thus with victory and with festivity
Lete I this noble duc to Atthenes ryde,
I leave this noble duke riding to Athens,
And al his hoost in armes hym bisyde.
And all his host in arms beside him.
And certes, if it nere to long to heere,
And certainly, if it were not too long to hear,
I wolde have toold yow fully the manere
I would have told you fully the manner
How wonnen was the regne of Femenye
How the reign of Femenye was won
By Theseus and by his chivalrye;
By Theseus and by his chivalry;
And of the grete bataille for the nones
And of the great battle at that time
Bitwixen Atthenes and Amazones;
Between Athenians and Amazons;
And how asseged was Ypolita,
And how Ypolita was besieged,
The faire, hardy queene of Scithia;
The fair, bold queen of Scithia;
And of the feste that was at hir weddynge,
And of the festivity that was at their wedding,
And of the tempest at hir hoom-comynge;
And of the storm at her home-coming;
But al that thyng I moot as now forbere.
But all that matter I must now forgo.
I have, God woot, a large feeld to ere,
I have, God knows, a large field to till,
And wayke been the oxen in my plough.
And the oxen in my plow are weak.
The remenant of the tale is long ynough.
The remnant of the tale is long enough.
I wol nat letten eek noon of this route;
Also I will not hinder any one of this company;
Lat every felawe telle his tale aboute,
Let every fellow tell his tale in turn,
And lat se now who shal the soper wynne;
And let's see now who shall win the supper;
And ther I lefte, I wol ayeyn bigynne.
And where I left off, I will again begin.
This duc, of whom I make mencioun,
This duke, of whom I make mention,
Whan he was come almoost unto the toun,
When he was come almost unto the town,
In al his wele and in his mooste pride,
In all his prosperity and in his most pride,
He was war, as he caste his eye aside,
He was aware, as he cast his eye aside,
Where that ther kneled in the heighe weye
Where there kneeled in the high way
A compaignye of ladyes, tweye and tweye,
A company of ladies, two by two,
Ech after oother clad in clothes blake;
Each after another, clad in black clothes;
But swich a cry and swich a wo they make
But such a cry and such a woeful (lament) they make
That in this world nys creature lyvynge
That in this world is no living creature
That herde swich another waymentynge;
That (ever) heard lamentation such as this;
And of this cry they nolde nevere stenten
And of this cry they would not ever stop
Til they the reynes of his brydel henten.
Until they seized the reins of his bridle.
"What folk been ye, that at myn hom-comynge
"What folk are you, who at my homecoming
Perturben so my feste with criynge?"
So disturb my festival with crying?"
Quod Theseus. "Have ye so greet envye
Said Theseus. "Have you such great envy
Of myn honour, that thus compleyne and crye?
Of my honor, (you) who thus lament and cry?
Or who hath yow mysboden or offended?
Or who has injured or offended you?
And telleth me if it may been amended,
And tell me if it may be remedied,
And why that ye been clothed thus in blak."
And why you are clothed thus in black."
The eldeste lady of them alle spak,
The eldest lady of them all spoke,
Whan she hadde swowned with a deedly cheere,
After she had swooned with (so) deadly a countenance,
That it was routhe for to seen and heere;
That it was pitiful to see and hear;
She seyde, "Lord, to whom Fortune hath yiven
She said, "Lord, to whom Fortune has given
Victorie, and as a conqueror to lyven,
Victory, and (allowed) to live as a conqueror,
Nat greveth us youre glorie and youre honour,
Your glory and your honor does not grieve us,
But we biseken mercy and socour.
But we beseech (you for) mercy and succor.
Have mercy on oure wo and oure distresse!
Have mercy on our woe and our distress!
Som drope of pitee, thurgh thy gentillesse,
Some drop of pity, because of thy nobility,
Upon us wrecched wommen lat thou falle,
Let thou fall upon us wretched women,
For, certes, lord, ther is noon of us alle
For, certainly, lord, there is not one of us all
That she ne hath been a duchesse or a queene.
Who has not been a duchesse or a queen.
Now be we caytyves, as it is wel seene,
Now we are miserable wretches, as it is easily seen,
Thanked be Fortune and hire false wheel,
Thanks be to Fortune and her false wheel,
That noon estaat assureth to be weel.
Who assures no estate (will continue) to be well.
And certes, lord, to abyden youre presence,
And certainly, lord, to await your presence,
Heere in this temple of the goddesse Clemence
Here in this temple of the goddess Clemency
We han ben waitynge al this fourtenyght.
We have been waiting all this fortnight.
Now help us, lord, sith it is in thy myght.
Now help us, lord, since it is in thy power.
"I, wrecche, which that wepe and wayle thus,
"I, wretch, who weep and wail thus,
Was whilom wyf to kyng Cappaneus,
Was once wife to king Cappaneus,
That starf at Thebes -- cursed be that day! --
Who died at Thebes -- cursed be that day! --
And alle we that been in this array
And all of us who are in this condition
And maken al this lamentacioun,
And make all this lamentation,
We losten alle oure housbondes at that toun,
We lost all our husbands at that town,
Whil that the seege theraboute lay.
While the siege lay around it.
And yet now the olde Creon -- weylaway! --
And yet now the old Creon -- woe oh woe! --
That lord is now of Thebes the citee,
Who is now lord of the city of Thebes,
Fulfild of ire and of iniquitee,
Filled with anger and with iniquity,
He, for despit and for his tirannye,
He, for spite and for his tyranny,
To do the dede bodyes vileynye
To do dishonor to the dead bodies
Of alle oure lordes whiche that been yslawe,
Of all our lords who are slain,
Hath alle the bodyes on an heep ydrawe,
Has dragged all the bodies in a heap,
And wol nat suffren hem, by noon assent,
And will not allow them, not at all,
Neither to been yburyed nor ybrent,
Neither to be buried nor burned,
But maketh houndes ete them in despit."
But makes hounds eat them as an insult."
And with that word, withouten moore respit,
And with that word, without more delay,
They fillen gruf and criden pitously,
They fell face down and cried piteously,
"Have on us wrecched wommen som mercy,
"Have some mercy on us wretched women,
And lat oure sorwe synken in thyn herte."
And let our sorrow sink in thy heart."
This gentil duc doun from his courser sterte
This gentle duke leaped down from his war horse
With herte pitous, whan he herde them speke.
With compassionate heart, when he heard them speak.
Hym thoughte that his herte wolde breke,
It seemed to him that his heart would break,
Whan he saugh hem so pitous and so maat,
When he saw them so pitiful and so dejected,
That whilom weren of so greet estaat;
That once were of such high rank;
And in his armes he hem alle up hente,
And in his arms he caught up them all,
And hem conforteth in ful good entente,
And comforts them with very good will,
And swoor his ooth, as he was trewe knyght,
And swore his oath, as he was true knight,
He wolde doon so ferforthly his myght
(That) he would do his might so completely
Upon the tiraunt Creon hem to wreke
To avenge them upon the tyrant Creon
That al the peple of Grece sholde speke
That all the people of Greece should speak (about)
How Creon was of Theseus yserved
How Creon was treated by Theseus
As he that hadde his deeth ful wel deserved.
As one who had very well deserved his death.
And right anoon, withouten moore abood,
And right away, without more delay,
His baner he desplayeth, and forth rood
He displays his banner, and rode forth
To Thebes-ward, and al his hoost biside.
Toward Thebes, and all his army beside (him).
No neer Atthenes wolde he go ne ride,
He would not walk nor ride any nearer to Athens,
Ne take his ese fully half a day,
Nor take his ease fully half a day,
But onward on his wey that nyght he lay,
But that night he lay (camped) on his way,
And sente anon Ypolita the queene,
And sent straightway Ypolita the queen,
And Emelye, hir yonge suster sheene,
And Emelye, her beautiful young sister,
Unto the toun of Atthenes to dwelle,
Unto the town of Athens to dwell,
And forth he rit; ther is namoore to telle.
And forth he rides; there is no more to tell.
The rede statue of Mars, with spere and targe,
The red statue of Mars, with spear and shield,
So shyneth in his white baner large
So shines in his large white banner
That alle the feeldes glyteren up and doun;
That all the fields glitter all around;
And by his baner born is his penoun
And by his banner is carried his pennon
Of gold ful riche, in which ther was ybete
Of very rich gold, in which there was embroidered
The Mynotaur, which that he wan in Crete.
The Minotaur, which he defeated in Crete.
Thus rit this duc, thus rit this conquerour,
Thus rides this duke, thus rides this conqueror,
And in his hoost of chivalrie the flour,
And in his army the flower of chivalry,
Til that he cam to Thebes and alighte
Until he came to Thebes and dismounted
Faire in a feeld, ther as he thoughte to fighte.
Graciously in a field, where he intended to fight.
But shortly for to speken of this thyng,
But briefly to speak of this thing,
With Creon, which that was of Thebes kyng,
With Creon, who was king of Thebes,
He faught, and slough hym manly as a knyght
He fought, and slew him boldly as a knight
In pleyn bataille, and putte the folk to flyght;
In open battle, and put the army to flight;
And by assaut he wan the citee after,
And by assault he won the city afterwards,
And rente adoun bothe wall and sparre and rafter;
And tore down both wall and beam and rafter;
And to the ladyes he restored agayn
And he gave back to the ladies
The bones of hir freendes that were slayn,
The bones of their husbands who were slain,
To doon obsequies, as was tho the gyse.
To do obsequies, as was then the custom.
But it were al to longe for to devyse
But it would be all too long to describe
The grete clamour and the waymentynge
The great clamor and the lamentation
That the ladyes made at the brennynge
That the ladies made at the burning
Of the bodies, and the grete honour
Of the bodies, and the great honor
That Theseus, the noble conquerour,
That Theseus, the noble conqueror,
Dooth to the ladyes, whan they from hym wente;
Does to the ladies, when they went from him;
But shortly for to telle is myn entente.
But briefly to tell is my intent.
Whan that this worthy duc, this Theseus,
When this worthy duke, this Theseus,
Hath Creon slayn and wonne Thebes thus,
Has slain Creon and thus won Thebes,
Stille in that feeld he took al nyght his reste,
Still in that field he took all night his rest,
And dide with al the contree as hym leste.
And did with all the country as he pleased.
To ransake in the taas of bodyes dede,
To search in the heap of dead bodies,
Hem for to strepe of harneys and of wede,
To strip them of armor and of clothing,
The pilours diden bisynesse and cure
The scavengers took great pains and worked hard
After the bataille and disconfiture.
After the battle and defeat.
And so bifel that in the taas they founde,
And (it) so befell that in the heap they found,
Thurgh-girt with many a grevous blody wounde,
Pierced through with many a grievous bloody wound,
Two yonge knyghtes liggynge by and by,
Two young knights lying side by side,
Bothe in oon armes, wroght ful richely,
Both with the same coat of arms, very richly wrought,
Of whiche two Arcita highte that oon,
Of which two one was called Arcite,
And that oother knyght highte Palamon.
And that other knight was called Palamon.
Nat fully quyke, ne fully dede they were,
They were not fully alive, nor fully dead,
But by hir cote-armures and by hir gere
But by their coats of arms and by their equipment
The heraudes knewe hem best in special
The heralds best knew them in particular
As they that weren of the blood roial
As they that were of the royal blood
Of Thebes, and of sustren two yborn.
Of Thebes, and born of two sisters.
Out of the taas the pilours han hem torn,
The scavengers have pulled them out of the heap,
And han hem caried softe unto the tente
And have carried them softy unto the tent
Of Theseus; and he ful soone hem sente
Of Theseus; and he very soon sent them
To Atthenes, to dwellen in prisoun
To Athens, to dwell in prison
Perpetuelly -- he nolde no raunsoun.
Perpetually -- he would not (accept) any ransom.
And whan this worthy duc hath thus ydon,
And when this worthy duke has thus done,
He took his hoost, and hoom he rit anon
He took his army, and home he rides straightway
With laurer crowned as a conquerour;
As a conqueror crowned with laurel;
And ther he lyveth in joye and in honour
And there he lives in joy and in honor
Terme of his lyf; what nedeth wordes mo?
For the duration of his life; what more words are needed?
And in a tour, in angwissh and in wo,
And in a tower, in anguish and in woe,
This Palamon and his felawe Arcite
This Palamon and his fellow Arcite
For everemoore; ther may no gold hem quite.
For evermore (remain); no gold can ransom them.
This passeth yeer by yeer and day by day,
This passes year by year and day by day,
Till it fil ones, in a morwe of May,
Until it befell once, in a morning of May,
That Emelye, that fairer was to sene
That Emelye, who was fairer to be seen
Than is the lylie upon his stalke grene,
Than is the lily upon its green stalk,
And fressher than the May with floures newe --
And fresher than the May with new flowers --
For with the rose colour stroof hire hewe,
For her hue vied with color of the rose,
I noot which was the fyner of hem two --
I do not know which was the finer of them two --
Er it were day, as was hir wone to do,
Before it was day, as was her custom to do,
She was arisen and al redy dight,
She was arisen and all ready prepared,
For May wole have no slogardie anyght.
For May will have no laziness at night.
The sesoun priketh every gentil herte,
The season urges on every gentle heart,
And maketh it out of his slep to sterte,
And makes it out of its sleep to awake suddenly,
And seith "Arys, and do thyn observaunce."
And says "Arise, and do thy observance."
This maked Emelye have remembraunce
This made Emelye remember
To doon honour to May, and for to ryse.
To do honor to May, and to rise.
Yclothed was she fressh, for to devyse:
She was gaily clothed, so to say:
Hir yelow heer was broyded in a tresse
Her yellow hair was braided in a tress
Bihynde hir bak, a yerde long, I gesse.
Behind her back, a yard long, I guess.
And in the gardyn, at the sonne upriste,
And in the garden, at the rising of the sun,
She walketh up and doun, and as hire liste
She walks up and down, and as she pleases
She gadereth floures, party white and rede,
She gathers flowers, mixed white and red,
To make a subtil gerland for hire hede;
To make an intricate garland for her head;
And as an aungel hevenysshly she soong.
And she sang (as) heavenly as an angel.
The grete tour, that was so thikke and stroong,
The great tower, that was so thick and strong,
Which of the castel was the chief dongeoun
Which was the main fortification of the castle
(Ther as the knyghtes weren in prisoun
(Where the knights were in prison
Of which I tolde yow and tellen shal),
Of which I told yow and shall tell),
Was evene joynant to the gardyn wal
Was just next to the garden wall
Ther as this Emelye hadde hir pleyynge.
Where this Emelye took her pleasure.
Bright was the sonne and cleer that morwenynge,
The sun was bright and clear that morning,
And Palamoun, this woful prisoner,
And Palamon, this woeful prisoner,
As was his wone, by leve of his gayler,
As was his custom, by permission of his jailer,
Was risen and romed in a chambre an heigh,
Had risen and roamed in a chamber on high,
In which he al the noble citee seigh,
In which he saw all the noble city,
And eek the gardyn, ful of braunches grene,
And also the garden, full of green branches,
Ther as this fresshe Emelye the shene
Where this fresh Emelye the bright
Was in hire walk, and romed up and doun.
Was in her walk, and roamed up and down.
This sorweful prisoner, this Palamoun,
This sorrowful prisoner, this Palamon,
Goth in the chambre romynge to and fro
Goes in the chamber roaming to and fro
And to hymself compleynynge of his wo.
And to himself lamenting his woe.
That he was born, ful ofte he seyde, "allas!"
That he was born, full often he said, "alas!"
And so bifel, by aventure or cas,
And so it happened, by chance or accident,
That thurgh a wyndow, thikke of many a barre
That through a window, thickly set with many a bar
Of iren greet and square as any sparre,
Of iron, great and square as any beam,
He cast his eye upon Emelya,
He cast his eye upon Emelye,
And therwithal he bleynte and cride, "A!"
And with that he turned pale and cried, "A!"
As though he stongen were unto the herte.
As though he were stabbed unto the heart.
And with that cry Arcite anon up sterte
And with that cry Arcite immediately leaped up
And seyde, "Cosyn myn, what eyleth thee,
And said, "My cousin, what ails thee,
That art so pale and deedly on to see?
Who art so pale and deadly to look upon?
Why cridestow? Who hath thee doon offence?
Why didst thou cry out? Who has done thee offence?
For Goddes love, taak al in pacience
For the love of God, take all in patience
Oure prisoun, for it may noon oother be.
Our imprisonment, for it may not be otherwise.
Fortune hath yeven us this adversitee.
Fortune has given us this adversity.
Som wikke aspect or disposicioun
Some wicked aspect or disposition
Of Saturne, by som constellacioun,
Of Saturn, by some arrangement of the heavenly bodies,
Hath yeven us this, although we hadde it sworn;
Has given us this, although we had sworn it would not be;
So stood the hevene whan that we were born.
So stood the heavens when we were born.
We moste endure it; this is the short and playn."
We must endure it; this is the short and plain."
This Palamon answerde and seyde agayn,
This Palamon answered and said in reply,
"Cosyn, for sothe, of this opinioun
"Cousin, truly, concerning this opinion
Thow hast a veyn ymaginacioun.
Thou hast a foolish conception.
This prison caused me nat for to crye,
This prison did not cause me to cry out,
But I was hurt right now thurghout myn ye
But I was hurt right now through my eye
Into myn herte, that wol my bane be.
Into my heart, so that it will be the death of me.
The fairnesse of that lady that I see
The fairness of that lady whom I see
Yond in the gardyn romen to and fro
Yonder in the garden roaming to and fro
Is cause of al my criyng and my wo.
Is cause of all my crying and my woe.
I noot wher she be womman or goddesse,
I know not whether she is woman or goddess,
But Venus is it soothly, as I gesse."
But truly it is Venus, as I suppose."
And therwithal on knees doun he fil,
And with that he fell down on his knees,
And seyde, "Venus, if it be thy wil
And said, "Venus, if it be thy will
Yow in this gardyn thus to transfigure
Thus to transfigure yourself in this garden
Bifore me, sorweful, wrecched creature,
Before me, sorrowful, wretched creature,
Out of this prisoun help that we may scapen.
Help that we may escape out of this prison.
And if so be my destynee be shapen
And if it be so that my destiny is shaped
By eterne word to dyen in prisoun,
By eternal decree to die in prison,
Of oure lynage have som compassioun,
Have some compassion on our (noble) lineage
That is so lowe ybroght by tirannye."
Which is brought so low by tyranny."
And with that word Arcite gan espye
And with that word Arcite did see
Wher as this lady romed to and fro,
Where this lady roamed to and fro,
And with that sighte hir beautee hurte hym so,
And with that sight her beauty hurt him so,
That, if that Palamon was wounded sore,
That, if Palamon was sorely wounded,
Arcite is hurt as muche as he, or moore.
Arcite is hurt as much as he, or more.
And with a sigh he seyde pitously,
And with a sigh he said piteously,
"The fresshe beautee sleeth me sodeynly
"The fresh beauty slays me suddenly
Of hire that rometh in the yonder place;
Of her who roams in the yonder place;
And but I have hir mercy and hir grace,
And unless I have her mercy and her grace,
That I may seen hire atte leeste weye,
So that I can at least see her,
I nam but deed; ther nis namoore to seye."
I am as good as dead; there is no more to say."
This Palamon, whan he tho wordes herde,
This Palamon, when he heard those words,
Dispitously he looked and answerde,
Angrily he looked and answered,
"Wheither seistow this in ernest or in pley?"
"Sayest thou this in earnest or in play?"
"Nay," quod Arcite, "in ernest, by my fey!
"Nay," said Arcite, "in earnest, by my faith!
God helpe me so, me list ful yvele pleye."
So help me God, I have no desire to play."
This Palamon gan knytte his browes tweye.
This Palamon did knit his two brows.
"It nere," quod he, "to thee no greet honour
"It would not be," said he, "any great honor to thee
For to be fals, ne for to be traitour
To be false, nor to be traitor
To me, that am thy cosyn and thy brother
To me, who am thy cousin and thy brother
Ysworn ful depe, and ech of us til oother,
Sworn very sincerely, and each of us to the other,
That nevere, for to dyen in the peyne,
That never, though we had to die by torture,
Til that the deeth departe shal us tweyne,
Until death shall part us two,
Neither of us in love to hyndre oother,
Neither of us in love (is) to hinder the other,
Ne in noon oother cas, my leeve brother,
Nor in any other case, my dear brother,
But that thou sholdest trewely forthren me
But rather thou shouldest truly help me
In every cas, as I shal forthren thee --
In every case, as I shall help thee --
This was thyn ooth, and myn also, certeyn;
This was thy oath, and mine also, certainly;
I woot right wel, thou darst it nat withseyn.
I know right well, thou darest not deny it.
Thus artow of my conseil, out of doute,
Thus thou art my trusted confidant, without doubt,
And now thow woldest falsly been aboute
And now thou wouldest falsely be busy preparing
To love my lady, whom I love and serve,
To love my lady, whom I love and serve,
And evere shal til that myn herte sterve.
And ever shall until my heart dies.
Nay, certes, false Arcite, thow shalt nat so.
Nay, certainly, false Arcite, thou shalt not (do) so.
I loved hire first, and tolde thee my wo
I loved hire first, and told thee my woe
As to my conseil and my brother sworn
As to my confidant and my sworn brother
To forthre me, as I have toold biforn.
To further me, as I have told before.
For which thou art ybounden as a knyght
For which thou art bound as a knight
To helpen me, if it lay in thy myght,
To help me, if it lay in thy power,
Or elles artow fals, I dar wel seyn."
Or else thou art false, I dare well say."
This Arcite ful proudly spak ageyn:
This Arcite full proudly spoke in return:
"Thow shalt," quod he, "be rather fals than I;
"Thou shalt," said he, "be rather false than I;
And thou art fals, I telle thee outrely,
And thou art false, I tell thee flatly,
For paramour I loved hire first er thow.
As a mistress I loved her first before thou.
What wiltow seyen? Thou woost nat yet now
What wilt thou say? Thou knowest not yet now
Wheither she be a womman or goddesse!
Whether she is a woman or goddess!
Thyn is affeccioun of hoolynesse,
Thine is a feeling of holiness,
And myn is love as to a creature;
And mine is love as to a creature;
For which I tolde thee myn aventure
For which I told thee my circumstance
As to my cosyn and my brother sworn.
As to my cousin and my sworn brother.
I pose that thow lovedest hire biforn;
I posit (this assumption): that thou lovedest her first;
Wostow nat wel the olde clerkes sawe,
Knowest thou not well the old clerks' saying,
That `who shal yeve a lovere any lawe?'
That `who shall give a lover any law?'
Love is a gretter lawe, by my pan,
Love is a greater law, by my skull,
Than may be yeve to any erthely man;
Than may be given to any earthly man;
And therfore positif lawe and swich decree
And therefore positive (man-made) law and such decree
Is broken al day for love in ech degree.
Is broken every day for love in every way.
A man moot nedes love, maugree his heed;
A man must of necessity love, in spite of all he can do;
He may nat fleen it, thogh he sholde be deed,
He can not flee (from) it, though he should be dead,
Al be she mayde, or wydwe, or elles wyf.
Whether she be maid, or widow, or else wife.
And eek it is nat likly al thy lyf
And also it is not likely all thy life
To stonden in hir grace; namoore shal I;
To stand in her good graces; no more shall I;
For wel thou woost thyselven, verraily,
For well thou thyself knowest, truly,
That thou and I be dampned to prisoun
That thou and I are condemned to prison
Perpetuelly; us gayneth no raunsoun.
Perpetually; no ransom can help us.
We stryve as dide the houndes for the boon;
We strive as the hounds did for the bone;
They foughte al day, and yet hir part was noon.
They fought all day, and yet their share was nothing.
Ther cam a kyte, whil that they were so wrothe,
There came a kite, while they were so angry,
And baar awey the boon bitwixe hem bothe.
And carried away the bone between them both.
And therfore, at the kynges court, my brother,
And therefore, at the king's court, my brother,
Ech man for hymself, ther is noon oother.
Each man for himself, there is no other (way).
Love, if thee list, for I love and ay shal;
Love, if it please thee, for I love and always shall;
And soothly, leeve brother, this is al.
And truly, dear brother, this is all.
Heere in this prisoun moote we endure,
Here in this prison we must endure,
And everich of us take his aventure."
And each one of us take his chance."
Greet was the strif and long bitwix hem tweye,
Great and long was the strife between them two,
If that I hadde leyser for to seye;
If I had leisure to tell (it);
But to th'effect. It happed on a day,
But to the point. It happened on a day,
To telle it yow as shortly as I may,
To tell it to you as briefly as I can,
A worthy duc that highte Perotheus,
A worthy duke that was called Perotheus,
That felawe was unto duc Theseus
Who was a friend to duke Theseus
Syn thilke day that they were children lite,
Since that same time that they were little children,
Was come to Atthenes his felawe to visite,
Had come to Athens to visit his friend,
And for to pleye as he was wont to do;
And to amuse himself as he was accustomed to do;
For in this world he loved no man so,
For in this world he loved no man so (much),
And he loved hym als tendrely agayn.
And he (Theseus) loved him as tenderly in turn.
So wel they lovede, as olde bookes sayn,
So well they loved, as old books say,
That whan that oon was deed, soothly to telle,
That when one was dead, truly to tell,
His felawe wente and soughte hym doun in helle --
His friend went and sought him down in hell --
But of that storie list me nat to write.
But of that story I do not desire to write.
Duc Perotheus loved wel Arcite,
Duke Perotheus loved well Arcite,
And hadde hym knowe at Thebes yeer by yere,
And had known him at Thebes year after year,
And finally at requeste and preyere
And finally at request and prayer
Of Perotheus, withouten any raunsoun,
Of Perotheus, without any ransom,
Duc Theseus hym leet out of prisoun
Duke Theseus let him out of prison
Frely to goon wher that hym liste over al,
Freely to go all over, wherever he wishes,
In swich a gyse as I you tellen shal.
In such a manner as shall I tell you.
This was the forward, pleynly for t'endite,
This was the agreement, plainly to write,
Bitwixen Theseus and hym Arcite:
Between Theseus and this Arcite:
That if so were that Arcite were yfounde
That if it so were that Arcite were found
Evere in his lif, by day or nyght, oo stounde
Ever in his life, by day or night, at any moment
In any contree of this Theseus,
In any country of this Theseus,
And he were caught, it was acorded thus,
And if he were caught, it was agreed thus,
That with a swerd he sholde lese his heed.
That with a sword he should lose his head.
Ther nas noon oother remedie ne reed;
There was no other remedy nor course of action;
But taketh his leve, and homward he him spedde.
But (he) takes his leave, and homeward he sped.
Lat hym be war! His nekke lith to wedde.
Let him be ware! His neck lies as a pledge.
How greet a sorwe suffreth now Arcite!
How great a sorrow now suffers Arcite!
The deeth he feeleth thurgh his herte smyte;
He feels the death smite through his heart;
He wepeth, wayleth, crieth pitously;
He weeps, wails, cries piteously;
To sleen hymself he waiteth prively.
To slay himself he secretly awaits (an opportunity).
He seyde, "Allas that day that I was born!
He said, "Alas that day that I was born!
Now is my prisoun worse than biforn;
Now my prison is worse than before;
Now is me shape eternally to dwelle
Now I am destined eternally to dwell
Noght in purgatorie, but in helle.
Not in purgatory, but in hell.
Allas, that evere knew I Perotheus!
Alas, that ever I knew Perotheus!
For elles hadde I dwelled with Theseus,
For else I would have remained with Theseus,
Yfetered in his prisoun everemo.
Fettered in his prison evermore.
Thanne hadde I been in blisse and nat in wo.
Then would I have been in bliss and not in woe.
Oonly the sighte of hire whom that I serve,
Only the sight of her whom I serve,
Though that I nevere hir grace may deserve,
Though I never can deserve her grace,
Wolde han suffised right ynough for me.
Would have sufficed right enough for me.
O deere cosyn Palamon," quod he,
O dear cousin Palamon," said he,
"Thyn is the victorie of this aventure.
"The victory of this adventure is thine.
Ful blisfully in prison maistow dure --
Very blissfully in prison thou can remain --
In prison? Certes nay, but in paradys!
In prison? Certainly not, but in paradise!
Wel hath Fortune yturned thee the dys,
Well has Fortune turned the dice for thee,
That hast the sighte of hire, and I th'absence.
That hast the sight of her, and I the absence.
For possible is, syn thou hast hire presence,
For it is possible, since thou hast her presence,
And art a knyght, a worthy and an able,
And art a knight, a worthy and an able (one),
That by som cas, syn Fortune is chaungeable,
That by some chance, since Fortune is changeable,
Thow maist to thy desir somtyme atteyne.
Thou mayest sometime attain thy desire.
But I, that am exiled and bareyne
But I, who am exiled and barren
Of alle grace, and in so greet dispeir
Of all grace, and in so great despair
That ther nys erthe, water, fir, ne eir,
That there is not earth, water, fire, nor air,
Ne creature that of hem maked is,
Nor creature that is made of them,
That may me helpe or doon confort in this,
That can help me or do comfort (to me) in this,
Wel oughte I sterve in wanhope and distresse.
Well ought I to die in despair and distress.
Farwel my lif, my lust, and my gladnesse!
Farwell my life, my desire, and my gladness!
"Allas, why pleynen folk so in commune
"Alas, why do folk so commonly complain
On purveiaunce of God, or of Fortune,
About the providence of God, or of Fortune,
That yeveth hem ful ofte in many a gyse
That gives them full often in many a manner
Wel bettre than they kan hemself devyse?
Much better than they can themselves imagine?
Som man desireth for to han richesse,
One man desires to have riches,
That cause is of his mordre or greet siknesse;
Which is the cause of his murder or great sickness;
And som man wolde out of his prisoun fayn,
And one man would happily (go) out of his prison,
That in his hous is of his meynee slayn.
Who is slain in his house by members of his household.
Infinite harmes been in this mateere.
Infinite harms are in this matter.
We witen nat what thing we preyen heere;
We know not what thing we pray for here;
We faren as he that dronke is as a mous.
We act like one who is drunk as a mouse.
A dronke man woot wel he hath an hous,
A drunk man knows well he has a house,
But he noot which the righte wey is thider,
But he does not know which is the right way to it,
And to a dronke man the wey is slider.
And to a drunk man the way is slippery.
And certes, in this world so faren we;
And certainly, so we fare in this world;
We seken faste after felicitee,
We seek eagerly after felicity,
But we goon wrong ful often, trewely.
But we go wrong very often, truly.
Thus may we seyen alle, and namely I,
Thus can we all say, and especially I,
That wende and hadde a greet opinioun
Who supposed and had a firm belief
That if I myghte escapen from prisoun,
That if I might escape from prison,
Thanne hadde I been in joye and parfit heele,
Then I would have been in joy and perfect well-being,
Ther now I am exiled fro my wele.
Whereas now I am exiled from my source of happiness.
Syn that I may nat seen you, Emelye,
Since I can not see you, Emelye,
I nam but deed; ther nys no remedye."
I am as good as dead; there is not any remedy."
Upon that oother syde Palamon,
Upon that other side Palamon,
Whan that he wiste Arcite was agon,
When he knew Arcite was gone,
Swich sorwe he maketh that the grete tour
He makes such sorrow that the great tour
Resouneth of his youlyng and clamour.
Resounds with his yowling and clamor.
The pure fettres on his shynes grete
The great fetters themselves on his shins
Weren of his bittre, salte teeres wete.
Were wet from his bitter, salt tears.
"Allas," quod he, "Arcita, cosyn myn,
"Alas," said he, "Arcite, cousin mine,
Of al oure strif, God woot, the fruyt is thyn.
Of all our strife, God knows, the profit is thine.
Thow walkest now in Thebes at thy large,
Thou walkest freely now in Thebes,
And of my wo thow yevest litel charge.
And thou care little about my woe.
Thou mayst, syn thou hast wisdom and manhede,
Thou mayest, since thou hast wisdom and manhood,
Assemblen alle the folk of oure kynrede,
Assemble all the folk of our family,
And make a werre so sharp on this citee
And make a war so sharp on this city
That by som aventure or some tretee
That by some chance or some treaty
Thow mayst have hire to lady and to wyf
Thou mayest have her as lady and as wife
For whom that I moste nedes lese my lyf.
For whom I must of necessity lose my life.
For, as by wey of possibilitee,
For, as by way of possibility,
Sith thou art at thy large, of prisoun free,
Since thou art at thy liberty, free of prison,
And art a lord, greet is thyn avauntage
And art a lord, thy advantage is great,
Moore than is myn, that sterve here in a cage.
More than is mine, who die here in a cage.
For I moot wepe and wayle, whil I lyve,
For I must weep and wail, while I live,
With al the wo that prison may me yive,
With all the woe that prison may give me,
And eek with peyne that love me yeveth also,
And also with pain that love gives me also,
That doubleth al my torment and my wo."
That doubles all my torment and my woe."
Therwith the fyr of jalousie up sterte
With that the fire of jealousy started up
Withinne his brest, and hente him by the herte
Within his breast, and seized him by the heart
So woodly that he lyk was to biholde
So madly that he was to look upon like
The boxtree or the asshen dede and colde.
The box tree or the ash dead and cold.
Thanne seyde he, "O crueel goddes that governe
Then said he, "O cruel gods that govern
This world with byndyng of youre word eterne,
This world with binding of your eternal word,
And writen in the table of atthamaunt
And write in the table of adamant (hardest of stones)
Youre parlement and youre eterne graunt,
Your decision and your eternal decree,
What is mankynde moore unto you holde
Why is mankind more obligated unto you
Than is the sheep that rouketh in the folde?
Than is the sheep that cowers in the sheepfold?
For slayn is man right as another beest,
For man is slain exactly like another beast,
And dwelleth eek in prison and arreest,
And dwells also in prison and detention,
And hath siknesse and greet adversitee,
And has sickness and great adversity,
And ofte tymes giltelees, pardee.
And often times guiltless, indeed.
"What governance is in this prescience,
"What (sort of) governance is in this foreknowledge,
That giltelees tormenteth innocence?
That torments guiltless innocence?
And yet encresseth this al my penaunce,
And yet this increases all my suffering,
That man is bounden to his observaunce,
That man is bound to his duty,
For Goddes sake, to letten of his wille,
For God's sake, to refrain from his desire,
Ther as a beest may al his lust fulfille.
Whereas a beast may fulfill all his desire.
And whan a beest is deed he hath no peyne;
And when a beast is dead he has no pain;
But man after his deeth moot wepe and pleyne,
But man after his death must weep and lament,
Though in this world he have care and wo.
Though in this world he may have (had) care and woe.
Withouten doute it may stonden so.
Without doubt such is the case.
The answere of this lete I to dyvynys,
The answer to this I leave to theologians,
But wel I woot that in this world greet pyne ys.
But well I know that great pain is in this world.
Allas, I se a serpent or a theef,
Alas, I see a serpent or a thief,
That many a trewe man hath doon mescheef,
That has done mischief to many a true man,
Goon at his large, and where hym list may turne.
Go at his liberty, and can go where he pleases.
But I moot been in prisoun thurgh Saturne,
But I must be in prison because of Saturn,
And eek thurgh Juno, jalous and eek wood,
And also because of Juno, jealous and also mad,
That hath destroyed wel ny al the blood
Who has destroyed well nigh all the blood
Of Thebes with his waste walles wyde;
Of Thebes with its wide devastated walls;
And Venus sleeth me on that oother syde
And Venus slays me on that other side
For jalousie and fere of hym Arcite."
For jealousy and fear of this Arcite."
Now wol I stynte of Palamon a lite,
Now will I cease (speaking of) of Palamon for a little while,
And lete hym in his prisoun stille dwelle,
And leave him to dwell in his prison still,
And of Arcita forth I wol yow telle.
And of Arcite forth I will tell you.
The somer passeth, and the nyghtes longe
The summer passes, and the long nights
Encressen double wise the peynes stronge
Increase doubly the strong pains
Bothe of the lovere and the prisoner.
Both of the lover and the prisoner.
I noot which hath the wofuller mester.
I know not which has the more woeful task.
For, shortly for to seyn, this Palamoun
For, briefly to say (it), this Palamon
Perpetuelly is dampned to prisoun,
Is damned perpetually to prison,
In cheynes and in fettres to been deed;
In chains and in fetters to be dead;
And Arcite is exiled upon his heed
And Arcite is exiled on threat of losing his head
For everemo, as out of that contree,
For evermore, out of that country,
Ne nevere mo ne shal his lady see.
Nor nevermore shall see his lady.
Yow loveres axe I now this questioun:
Yow lovers now I ask this question:
Who hath the worse, Arcite or Palamoun?
Who has the worse, Arcite or Palamon?
That oon may seen his lady day by day,
That one may see his lady every day,
But in prison he moot dwelle alway;
But in prison he must always dwell;
That oother wher hym list may ride or go,
That other where he pleases may ride or walk,
But seen his lady shal he nevere mo.
But he shall see his lady nevermore.
Now demeth as yow liste, ye that kan,
Now judge as it pleases you, you who know (of such things),
For I wol telle forth as I bigan.
For I will tell forth as I began.
Whan that Arcite to Thebes comen was,
When Arcite was come to Thebes,
Ful ofte a day he swelte and seyde "Allas!"
Very often each day he grew faint and said "Alas!"
For seen his lady shal he nevere mo.
For he shall never more see his lady.
And shortly to concluden al his wo,
And shortly to conclude (telling) all his woe,
So muche sorwe hadde nevere creature
So much sorrow never had creature
That is, or shal, whil that the world may dure.
That is, or shall (be), while the world may endure.
His slep, his mete, his drynke, is hym biraft,
He is bereft of his sleep, his food, his drink
That lene he wex and drye as is a shaft;
So that he became lean and dry as is a stick;
His eyen holwe and grisly to biholde,
His eyes sunken and grisly to behold,
His hewe falow and pale as asshen colde,
His hue sickly yellow and pale as cold ashes,
And solitarie he was and evere allone,
And he was solitary and ever alone,
And waillynge al the nyght, makynge his mone;
And wailing all the night, making his moan;
And if he herde song or instrument,
And if he heard song or instrument,
Thanne wolde he wepe, he myghte nat be stent.
Then would he weep, he could not be stopped.
So feble eek were his spiritz, and so lowe,
So feeble also were his spirits, and so low,
And chaunged so, that no man koude knowe
And changed so, that no man could know
His speche nor his voys, though men it herde.
His speech nor his voice, though men heard it.
And in his geere for al the world he ferde
And in his behavior for all the world he fared
Nat oonly lik the loveris maladye
Not only like the lover's malady
Of Hereos, but rather lyk manye,
Of Hereos, but rather like mania,
Engendred of humour malencolik
Engendered by the melancholic humor
Biforen, in his celle fantastik.
In the front lobe, in his imagination.
And shortly, turned was al up so doun
And shortly, all was turned topsy-turvy
Bothe habit and eek disposicioun
Both the physical condition and also the mental disposition
Of hym, this woful lovere daun Arcite.
Of him, this woeful lover dan Arcite.
What sholde I al day of his wo endite?
Why should I all daylong write of his woe?
Whan he endured hadde a yeer or two
When he had endured a year or two
This crueel torment and this peyne and wo,
This cruel torment and this pain and woe,
At Thebes, in his contree, as I seyde,
At Thebes, in his country, as I said,
Upon a nyght in sleep as he hym leyde,
Upon one night as he laid himself in sleep,
Hym thoughte how that the wynged god Mercurie
It seemed to him that the winged god Mercury
Biforn hym stood and bad hym to be murie.
Stood before him and commanded him to be merry.
His slepy yerde in hond he bar uprighte;
His sleep-inducing staff he carried upright in his hand;
An hat he werede upon his heris brighte.
He wore a hat upon his bright hair.
Arrayed was this god, as he took keep,
This god was dressed, as he (Arcite) noticed,
As he was whan that Argus took his sleep;
As he was when he put Argus to sleep;
And seyde hym thus: "To Atthenes shaltou wende,
And said to him thus: "To Athens shalt thou go,
Ther is thee shapen of thy wo an ende."
Where an end of thy woe is destined for thee."
And with that word Arcite wook and sterte.
And with that word Arcite awoke and leaped up.
"Now trewely, hou soore that me smerte,"
"Now truly, however sorely it may pain me,"
Quod he, "to Atthenes right now wol I fare,
Said he, "I will go to Athens right now,
Ne for the drede of deeth shal I nat spare
Nor shall I refrain for the dread of death
To se my lady, that I love and serve.
From seeing my lady, whom I love and serve.
In hire presence I recche nat to sterve."
In her presence I care not if I die."
And with that word he caughte a greet mirour,
And with that word he picked up a large mirror,
And saugh that chaunged was al his colour,
And saw that all his color was changed,
And saugh his visage al in another kynde.
And saw his visage all (changed) to another sort.
And right anon it ran hym in his mynde,
And right away it ran to him in his mind,
That, sith his face was so disfigured
That, since his face was so disfigured
Of maladye the which he hadde endured,
By the malady which he had endured,
He myghte wel, if that he bar hym lowe,
He might well, if he conducted himself humbly,
Lyve in Atthenes everemoore unknowe,
Live in Athens evermore unknown,
And seen his lady wel ny day by day.
And see his lady almost every day.
And right anon he chaunged his array,
And right away he changed his clothing,
And cladde hym as a povre laborer,
And clad himself as a poor laborer,
And al allone, save oonly a squier
And all alone, except only a squire
That knew his privetee and al his cas,
Who knew his private affairs and all his situation,
Which was disgised povrely as he was,
Who was disguised as poorly as he was,
To Atthenes is he goon the nexte way.
To Athens he is gone the nearest way.
And to the court he wente upon a day,
And to the court he went upon a day,
And at the gate he profreth his servyse
And at the gate he offers his service
To drugge and drawe, what so men wol devyse.
To drudge and draw water, whatever men will command.
And shortly of this matere for to seyn,
And shortly to speak of this matter,
He fil in office with a chamberleyn
He was given employment by a household attendant
The which that dwellynge was with Emelye,
Who was dwelling with Emelye,
For he was wys and koude soone espye,
For he was wise and could soon take the measure
Of every servaunt, which that serveth here.
Of every servant, who serves here.
Wel koude he hewen wode, and water bere,
He could well hew wood, and carry water,
For he was yong and myghty for the nones,
For he was young and mighty indeed,
And therto he was long and big of bones
And moreover he was tall and strong of bones
To doon that any wight kan hym devyse.
To do what any one can command him.
A yeer or two he was in this servyse,
A year or two he was in this service,
Page of the chambre of Emelye the brighte,
Page of the chamber of Emelye the bright,
And Philostrate he seyde that he highte.
And he said that he was called Philostrate.
But half so wel biloved a man as he
But half so well beloved a man as he
Ne was ther nevere in court of his degree;
Was never in court (anyone) of his rank;
He was so gentil of condicioun
He was so noble in manner
That thurghout al the court was his renoun.
That his fame was (spread) throughout all the court .
They seyden that it were a charitee
They said that it would be a act of charity
That Theseus wolde enhauncen his degree,
If Theseus would advance his rank,
And putten hym in worshipful servyse,
And put him in noble employment,
Ther as he myghte his vertu excercise.
Where he could exercise his abilities.
And thus withinne a while his name is spronge,
And thus within a short time his fame is sprung,
Bothe of his dedes and his goode tonge,
Both for his deeds and his good speech,
That Theseus hath taken hym so neer
That Theseus has taken him so near
That of his chambre he made hym a squier,
That he has made him a squire of his chamber,
And gaf hym gold to mayntene his degree.
And gave him gold to maintain (a life style suitable to) his rank.
And eek men broghte hym out of his contree,
And also men brought him out of his country,
From yeer to yeer, ful pryvely his rente;
From year to year, very secretly, his income;
But honestly and slyly he it spente,
But properly and slyly he spent it,
That no man wondred how that he it hadde.
So that no man wondered how he acquired it.
And thre yeer in this wise his lif he ladde,
And three years in this manner he led his life,
And bar hym so, in pees and eek in werre,
And conducted himself so that, in peace and also in war,
Ther was no man that Theseus hath derre.
There was no man whom Theseus holds dearer.
And in this blisse lete I now Arcite,
And in this bliss I now leave Arcite,
And speke I wole of Palamon a lite.
And I will speak of Palamon a little.
In derknesse and horrible and strong prisoun
In darkness and horrible and strong imprisonment
Thise seven yeer hath seten Palamoun
These seven years Palamon has sat
Forpyned, what for wo and for distresse.
Wasted by suffering, what for woe and for distress.
Who feeleth double soor and hevynesse
Who feels double pain and sadness
But Palamon, that love destreyneth so
But Palamon, whom love so afflicts
That wood out of his wit he goth for wo?
That he goes mad, out of his wits because of woe?
And eek therto he is a prisoner
And also moreover he is a prisoner
Perpetuelly, noght oonly for a yer.
Perpetually, not just for a year.
Who koude ryme in Englyssh proprely
Who could rime in English properly
His martirdom? For sothe it am nat I;
His martyrdom? In truth it is not I;
Therfore I passe as lightly as I may.
Therefore I pass on as quickly as I can.
It fel that in the seventhe yer, of May
It happened that in the seventh year, of May
The thridde nyght (as olde bookes seyn,
The third night (as old books say,
That al this storie tellen moore pleyn),
That tell all this story more fully),
Were it by aventure or destynee --
Whether it was by chance or fate --
As, whan a thyng is shapen, it shal be --
As, when a thing is pre-ordained, it must be --
That soone after the mydnyght Palamoun,
That soon after midnight Palamon,
By helpyng of a freend, brak his prisoun
With the help of a friend, broke out of his prison
And fleeth the citee faste as he may go.
And flees the city as fast as he can go.
For he hadde yeve his gayler drynke so
For he had so given his jailer drink
Of a clarree maad of a certeyn wyn,
Of a spiced and sweetened drink made of a certain wine,
With nercotikes and opie of Thebes fyn,
With narcotics and pure opium of Thebes,
That al that nyght, thogh that men wolde him shake,
That all that night, though men would shake him,
The gayler sleep; he myghte nat awake.
The jailer slept; he could not awake.
And thus he fleeth as faste as evere he may.
And thus he flees as fast as ever he can.
The nyght was short and faste by the day
The night was short and very close to the day
That nedes cost he moot hymselven hyde,
So that by necessity he must hide himself,
And til a grove faste ther bisyde
And to a grove close by
With dredeful foot thanne stalketh Palamon.
With fearful foot then stalks Palamon.
For, shortly, this was his opinion:
For, shortly, this was his idea:
That in that grove he wolde hym hyde al day,
That in that grove he would hide himself all day,
And in the nyght thanne wolde he take his way
And in the night then he would take his way
To Thebes-ward, his freendes for to preye
Toward Thebes, to pray his friends
On Theseus to helpe him to werreye;
To help him to wage war on Theseus;
And shortly, outher he wolde lese his lif
And shortly, he would either lose his life
Or wynnen Emelye unto his wyf.
Or win Emelye to be his wife.
This is th'effect and his entente pleyn.
This is the purpose and his full intent.
Now wol I turne to Arcite ageyn,
Now I will turn again to Arcite,
That litel wiste how ny that was his care,
That little knew how near his trouble was,
Til that Fortune had broght him in the snare.
To which Fortune had brought him in the snare.
The bisy larke, messager of day,
The busy lark, messenger of day,
Salueth in hir song the morwe gray,
Salutes the morning gray in her song,
And firy Phebus riseth up so bright
And fiery Phoebus rises up so bright
That al the orient laugheth of the light,
That all the orient laughs because of the light,
And with his stremes dryeth in the greves
And with his rays dries in the groves
The silver dropes hangynge on the leves.
The silver drops hanging on the leaves.
And Arcita, that in the court roial
And Arcite, who in the royal court
With Theseus is principal squier,
With Theseus is chief squire,
Is risen and looketh on the myrie day.
Is risen and looks on the merry day.
And for to doon his observaunce to May,
And to do his observance to May,
Remembrynge on the poynt of his desir,
Meditating on the object of his desire,
He on a courser, startlynge as the fir,
He on a war horse, leaping about like the fire,
Is riden into the feeldes hym to pleye,
Has ridden into the fields to amuse himself,
Out of the court, were it a myle or tweye.
Out of the court, about a mile or two.
And to the grove of which that I yow tolde
And to the grove of which I told you
By aventure his wey he gan to holde
By chance he began to hold his way
To maken hym a gerland of the greves,
To make himself a garland of the branches,
Were it of wodebynde or hawethorn leves,
Were it of woodbine or hawthorn leaves,
And loude he song ayeyn the sonne shene:
And loud he sang in the bright sun:
"May, with alle thy floures and thy grene,
"May, with all thy flowers and thy greenery,
Welcome be thou, faire, fresshe May,
Welcome be thou, fair, fresh May,
In hope that I som grene gete may."
In hope that I can get something green."
And from his courser, with a lusty herte,
And from his war horse, with an eager heart,
Into the grove ful hastily he sterte,
He rushed into the grove hastily,
And in a path he rometh up and doun,
And in a path he roams up and down,
Ther as by aventure this Palamoun
Where by chance this Palamon
Was in a bussh, that no man myghte hym se,
Was in a thicket, so that no man could see him,
For soore afered of his deeth was he.
For he was sorely afraid of his death.
No thyng ne knew he that it was Arcite;
In no way did he know that it was Arcite;
God woot he wolde have trowed it ful lite.
God knows he would scarcely have believed it
But sooth is seyd, go sithen many yeres,
But truly it is said, since many years ago,
That "feeld hath eyen and the wode hath eres."
That "field has eyes and the wood has ears."
It is ful fair a man to bere hym evene,
It is very good for a man to act calmly,
For al day meeteth men at unset stevene.
For every day people meet at unexpected times.
Ful litel woot Arcite of his felawe,
Arcite knows full little of his fellow,
That was so ny to herknen al his sawe,
Who was near enough to hear all his speech,
For in the bussh he sitteth now ful stille.
For in the thicket he sits now very still.
Whan that Arcite hadde romed al his fille,
When Arcite had roamed all his fill,
And songen al the roundel lustily,
And sung all the rondel cheerfully,
Into a studie he fil sodeynly,
He fell suddenly into a state of anxiety,
As doon thise loveres in hir queynte geres,
As these lovers do in their strange manners,
Now in the crope, now doun in the breres,
Now in the tree top, now down in the briars,
Now up, now doun, as boket in a welle.
Now up, now down, like a bucket in a well.
Right as the Friday, soothly for to telle,
Exactly like the Friday, truly for to tell,
Now it shyneth, now it reyneth faste,
Now it shines, now it rains hard,
Right so kan geery Venus overcaste
Just so can fickle Venus sadden
The hertes of hir folk; right as hir day
The hearts of her folk; just as her day
Is gereful, right so chaungeth she array.
Is changeable, just so she changes her array.
Selde is the Friday al the wowke ylike.
Friday is seldom like all the rest of the week.
Whan that Arcite had songe, he gan to sike
When Arcite had sung, he began to sigh
And sette hym doun withouten any moore.
And sat himself down without any more.
"Allas," quod he, "that day that I was bore!
"Alas," he said, "that day that I was born!
How longe, Juno, thurgh thy crueltee,
How long, Juno, through thy cruelty,
Woltow werreyen Thebes the citee?
Wilt thou make war on the city of Thebes?
Allas, ybroght is to confusioun
Alas, to ruin is brought
The blood roial of Cadme and Amphioun --
The royal blood of Cadmus and Amphion --
Of Cadmus, which that was the firste man
Of Cadmus, who was the first man
That Thebes bulte, or first the toun bigan,
Who built Thebes, before the town first began,
And of the citee first was crouned kyng.
And first was crowned king of the city.
Of his lynage am I and his ofspryng
I am of his lineage and his offspring
By verray ligne, as of the stok roial,
By true lineage, of the royal family,
And now I am so caytyf and so thral,
And now I am so wretched and so enslaved,
That he that is my mortal enemy,
That he who is my mortal enemy,
I serve hym as his squier povrely.
I meekly serve him as his squire.
And yet dooth Juno me wel moore shame,
And yet Juno does me much more shame,
For I dar noght biknowe myn owene name;
For I dare not acknowledge my own name;
But ther as I was wont to highte Arcite,
But whereas I was accustomed to be called Arcite,
Now highte I Philostrate, noght worth a myte.
Now I am called Philostrate, not worth a penny.
Allas, thou felle Mars! Allas, Juno!
Alas, thou fierce Mars! Alas, Juno!
Thus hath youre ire oure lynage al fordo,
Thus has your anger destroyed all our lineage,
Save oonly me and wrecched Palamoun,
Save only me and wretched Palamon,
That Theseus martireth in prisoun.
Whom Theseus torments in prison.
And over al this, to sleen me outrely
And in addition to all this, to slay me utterly
Love hath his firy dart so brennyngly
Love has his fiery dart so ardently
Ystiked thurgh my trewe, careful herte
Stabbed through my faithful, sorrowful heart
That shapen was my deeth erst than my sherte.
That my death was destined before my first garment was made.
Ye sleen me with youre eyen, Emelye!
You slay me with your eyes, Emelye!
Ye been the cause wherfore that I dye.
You are the cause by which I die.
Of al the remenant of myn oother care
Of all the rest of my other troubles
Ne sette I nat the montance of a tare,
I do not reckon at the value of a weed,
So that I koude doon aught to youre plesaunce."
Provided that I could do anything to please you."
And with that word he fil doun in a traunce
And with that word he fell down in a trance
A longe tyme, and after he up sterte.
A long time, and afterwards he leaped up.
This Palamoun, that thoughte that thurgh his herte
This Palamon, that thought that through his heart
He felte a coold swerd sodeynliche glyde,
He felt a cold sword suddenly glide,
For ire he quook; no lenger wolde he byde.
For anger he trembled; no longer would he wait.
And whan that he had herd Arcites tale,
And when he had heard Arcite's tale,
As he were wood, with face deed and pale,
As if he were mad, with face dead and pale,
He stirte hym up out of the buskes thikke
He leaped up out of the thick bushes
And seide: "Arcite, false traytour wikke,
And said: "Arcite, false, wicked traitor,
Now artow hent, that lovest my lady so,
Now art thou taken, who lovest my lady so,
For whom that I have al this peyne and wo,
For whom that I have all this pain and woe,
And art my blood, and to my conseil sworn,
And art of my blood, and sworn to be in my confidence,
As I ful ofte have told thee heerbiforn,
As I full often have told thee before now,
And hast byjaped heere duc Theseus,
And hast tricked here duke Theseus,
And falsly chaunged hast thy name thus!
And thus hast falsely changed thy name!
I wol be deed, or elles thou shalt dye.
I will be dead, or else thou shalt die.
Thou shalt nat love my lady Emelye,
Thou shalt not love my lady Emelye,
But I wol love hire oonly and namo;
But I will love her only and no other;
For I am Palamon, thy mortal foo.
For I am Palamon, thy mortal foe.
And though that I no wepene have in this place,
And though I have no weapon in this place,
But out of prison am astert by grace,
But out of prison am escaped by good luck,
I drede noght that outher thow shalt dye,
I doubt not that either thou shalt dye,
Or thow ne shalt nat loven Emelye.
Either thou shalt not love Emelye,
Chees which thou wolt, or thou shalt nat asterte!"
Choose which thou wish, or thou shalt not escape!"
This Arcite, with ful despitous herte,
This Arcite, with full spiteful heart,
Whan he hym knew, and hadde his tale herd,
When he knew him, and had heard his tale,
As fiers as leon pulled out his swerd,
As fierce as a lion pulled out his sword,
And seyde thus: "By God that sit above,
And said thus: "By God who sits above,
Nere it that thou art sik and wood for love,
Were it not that thou art sick and mad for love,
And eek that thow no wepne hast in this place,
And also because thou hast no weapon in this place,
Thou sholdest nevere out of this grove pace,
Thou shouldest never walk out of this grove,
That thou ne sholdest dyen of myn hond.
Rather thou shouldest die of my hand.
For I defye the seurete and the bond
For I repudiate the pledge and the bond
Which that thou seist that I have maad to thee.
Which thou sayest that I have made to thee.
What! Verray fool, thynk wel that love is free,
Lo! True fool, think well that love is free,
And I wol love hire maugree al thy myght!
And I will love her in spite of all thy might!
But for as muche thou art a worthy knyght
But for as much as thou art a worthy knight
And wilnest to darreyne hire by bataille,
And desire to decide the right to her by battle,
Have heer my trouthe; tomorwe I wol nat faille,
Have here my pledge; tomorrow I will not fail,
Withoute wityng of any oother wight,
Without the knowledge of any other person,
That heere I wol be founden as a knyght,
But here I will be found as a knight,
And bryngen harneys right ynough for thee;
And bring armor right enough for thee;
And ches the beste, and leef the worste for me.
And choose the best, and leave the worst for me.
And mete and drynke this nyght wol I brynge
And food and drink this night will I bring
Ynough for thee, and clothes for thy beddynge.
Enough for thee, and bed-clothes for thy bedding.
And if so be that thou my lady wynne,
And if it so be that thou win my lady,
And sle me in this wode ther I am inne,
And slay me in this wood where I am in,
Thow mayst wel have thy lady as for me."
Thou mayest well have thy lady as far as I am concerned."
This Palamon answerde, "I graunte it thee."
This Palamon answered, "I agree."
And thus they been departed til amorwe,
And thus they are departed until morning,
Whan ech of hem had leyd his feith to borwe.
When each of them had laid his faith as a pledge.
O Cupide, out of alle charitee!
O Cupid, devoid of all kindness to others!
O regne, that wolt no felawe have with thee!
O reign, that will have no partner with thee!
Ful sooth is seyd that love ne lordshipe
Full truly it is said that love nor lordship
Wol noght, his thankes, have no felaweshipe.
Will not, willingly, have any partnership.
Wel fynden that Arcite and Palamoun.
Arcite and Palamon well find that (to be true).
Arcite is riden anon unto the toun,
Arcite has ridden immediately into the town,
And on the morwe, er it were dayes light,
And on the morning, before it was day's light,
Ful prively two harneys hath he dight,
Very secretly he has prepared two sets of armor,
Bothe suffisaunt and mete to darreyne
Both sufficient and suitable to decide
The bataille in the feeld bitwix hem tweyne;
The battle in the field between them two;
And on his hors, allone as he was born,
And on his horse, alone as he was born,
He carieth al the harneys hym biforn.
He carries all the armor before him.
And in the grove, at tyme and place yset,
And in the grove, at time and place set,
This Arcite and this Palamon ben met.
This Arcite and this Palamon are met.
To chaungen gan the colour in hir face;
The color in their faces began to change;
Right as the hunters in the regne of Trace,
Just as the hunters in the reign of Thrace,
That stondeth at the gappe with a spere,
He who stands at the gap in the forrest with a spear,
Whan hunted is the leon or the bere,
When the lion or the bear is hunted,
And hereth hym come russhyng in the greves,
And hears him come rushing in the bushes,
And breketh bothe bowes and the leves,
And breaks both boughs and the leaves,
And thynketh, "Heere cometh my mortal enemy!
And thinks, "Here comes my mortal enemy!
Withoute faille, he moot be deed, or I,
Without fail, he must be dead, or I,
For outher I moot sleen hym at the gappe,
For either I must slay him at the gap,
Or he moot sleen me, if that me myshappe."
Or he must slay me, if I suffer misfortune."
So ferden they in chaungyng of hir hewe,
So fared they in changing colors of their faces,
As fer as everich of hem oother knewe.
When each of them knew the other.
Ther nas no good day, ne no saluyng,
There was no 'good day,' nor no salutations,
But streight, withouten word or rehersyng,
But straightway, without word or conversing,
Everich of hem heelp for to armen oother
Each one of them helped to arm the other
As freendly as he were his owene brother;
As friendly as if he were his own brother;
And after that, with sharpe speres stronge
And after that, with sharp strong spears
They foynen ech at oother wonder longe.
They thrust at each other a wonderfully long time.
Thou myghtest wene that this Palamon
Thou mightest suppose that this Palamon
In his fightyng were a wood leon,
In his fighting was a mad lion,
And as a crueel tigre was Arcite;
And Arcite was like a cruel tiger;
As wilde bores gonne they to smyte,
They began to smite like wild boars,
That frothen whit as foom for ire wood.
That froth at the mouth white as foam for mad anger.
Up to the ancle foghte they in hir blood.
They fought up to the ankle in their blood.
And in this wise I lete hem fightyng dwelle,
And in this manner I leave them to remain fighting,
And forth I wole of Theseus yow telle.
And forth I will tell you of Theseus.
The destinee, ministre general,
The destiny, general minister,
That executeth in the world over al
That executes in the world everywhere
The purveiaunce that God hath seyn biforn,
The providence that God has foreseen,
So strong it is that, though the world had sworn
So strong it is that, though the world had sworn
The contrarie of a thyng by ye or nay,
The contrary of a thing by yes or no,
Yet somtyme it shal fallen on a day
Yet sometimes it shall happen on one day
That falleth nat eft withinne a thousand yeer.
That happens not again in a thousand years.
For certeinly, oure appetites heer,
For certainly, our desires here,
Be it of werre, or pees, or hate, or love,
Be it of war, or peace, or hate, or love,
Al is this reuled by the sighte above.
All this is ruled by the foresight above.
This mene I now by myghty Theseus,
I mean this now in regard to mighty Theseus,
That for to hunten is so desirus,
Who is so desirous to hunt,
And namely at the grete hert in May,
And especially at the large hart in May,
That in his bed ther daweth hym no day
That in his bed there dawns for him no day
That he nys clad, and redy for to ryde
That he is not clad, and ready to ride
With hunte and horn and houndes hym bisyde.
With huntsman and horn and hounds beside him.
For in his huntyng hath he swich delit
For in his hunting he has such delight
That it is al his joye and appetit
That it is all his joy and desire
To been hymself the grete hertes bane,
To be himself the large hart's slayer,
For after Mars he serveth now Dyane.
For next to Mars he now serves Diana.
Cleer was the day, as I have toold er this,
The day was clear, as I have told before this,
And Theseus with alle joye and blis,
And Theseus with all joy and bliss,
With his Ypolita, the faire queene,
With his Ypolita, the faire queen,
And Emelye, clothed al in grene,
And Emelye, clothed all in green,
On huntyng be they riden roially.
On hunting they are ridden royally.
And to the grove that stood ful faste by,
And to the grove that stood very close by,
In which ther was an hert, as men hym tolde,
In which there was a hart, so people told him,
Duc Theseus the streighte wey hath holde.
Duke Theseus has held the straight way.
And to the launde he rideth hym ful right,
And directly to the glade he rides,
For thider was the hert wont have his flight,
For through there the hart was accustomed to take his escape,
And over a brook, and so forth on his weye.
And (flee) over a brook, and so forth on his way.
This duc wol han a cours at hym or tweye
This duke will have a run or two at him
With houndes swiche as that hym list comaunde.
With such hounds as he pleases to command.
And whan this duc was come unto the launde,
And when this duke was come unto the glade,
Under the sonne he looketh, and anon
He looks toward the sun, and immediately
He was war of Arcite and Palamon,
He was aware of Arcite and Palamon,
That foughten breme as it were bores two.
Who fought as fiercely as if it were two wild boars.
The brighte swerdes wenten to and fro
The bright swords went to and fro
So hidously that with the leeste strook
So hideously that with the weakest stroke
It semed as it wolde felle an ook.
It seemed as if it would fell an oak.
But what they were, no thyng he ne woot.
But who they were, he knew nothing.
This duc his courser with his spores smoot,
This duke smote his warhorse with his spurs,
And at a stert he was bitwix hem two,
And with a sudden leap he was between them two,
And pulled out a swerd and cride, "Hoo!
And pulled out a sword and cried, "Stop!
Namoore, up peyne of lesynge of youre heed!
No more, on the penalty of the loss of your head!
By myghty Mars, he shal anon be deed
By mighty Mars, he shall at once be dead
That smyteth any strook that I may seen.
Who smites any stroke that I can see.
But telleth me what myster men ye been,
But tell me what sort of men you are,
That been so hardy for to fighten heere
Who are so bold as to fight here
Withouten juge or oother officere,
Without judge or other officer,
As it were in a lystes roially."
As it would be in a properly conducted duel,"
This Palamon answerde hastily
This Palamon answered hastily
And seyde, "Sire, what nedeth wordes mo?
And said, "Sire, what more words are needed?
We have the deeth disserved bothe two.
We have deserved the death, both of us two.
Two woful wrecches been we, two caytyves,
Two woeful wretches are we, two miserable people,
That been encombred of oure owene lyves;
Who are burdened down by our own lives;
And as thou art a rightful lord and juge,
And as thou art a rightful lord and judge,
Ne yif us neither mercy ne refuge,
Give us neither mercy nor refuge,
But sle me first, for seinte charitee!
But slay me first, by holy charity!
But sle my felawe eek as wel as me;
But slay my fellow also as well as me;
Or sle hym first, for though thow knowest it lite,
Or slay him first, for though thou little knowest it,
This is thy mortal foo, this is Arcite,
This is thy mortal foe, this is Arcite,
That fro thy lond is banysshed on his heed,
Who is banished from thy land on (pain of losing) his head,
For which he hath deserved to be deed.
For which he has deserved to be dead.
For this is he that cam unto thy gate
For this is he that came unto thy gate
And seyde that he highte Philostrate.
And said that he was called Philostrate.
Thus hath he japed thee ful many a yer,
Thus has he tricked thee for many years,
And thou hast maked hym thy chief squier;
And thou hast made him thy chief squire;
And this is he that loveth Emelye.
And this is he that loves Emelye.
For sith the day is come that I shal dye,
For since the day is come that I must dye,
I make pleynly my confessioun
I make plainly my confession
That I am thilke woful Palamoun
That I am that same woeful Palamon
That hath thy prisoun broken wikkedly.
That wickedly has broken (out of) thy prison.
I am thy mortal foo, and it am I
I am thy mortal foe, and it is I
That loveth so hoote Emelye the brighte
Who loves the beautiful Emelye so passionately
That I wol dye present in hir sighte.
That I will die at this moment in her sight.
Wherfore I axe deeth and my juwise;
Therefore I ask death and my judicial sentence;
But sle my felawe in the same wise,
But slay my fellow in the same way,
For bothe han we deserved to be slayn."
For we have both deserved to be slain."
This worthy duc answerde anon agayn,
This worthy duke answered at once in reply,
And seyde, "This is a short conclusioun.
And said, "This is a brief (easy) decision.
Youre owene mouth, by youre confessioun,
Your own mouth, by your confession,
Hath dampned yow, and I wol it recorde;
Has condemned you, and I will pronounce it;
It nedeth noght to pyne yow with the corde.
There is no deed to torture you with the cord.
Ye shal be deed, by myghty Mars the rede!"
You shall be dead, by mighty Mars the red!"
The queene anon, for verray wommanhede,
The queen at once, for true womanliness,
Gan for to wepe, and so dide Emelye,
Began to weep, and so did Emelye,
And alle the ladyes in the compaignye.
And all the ladies in the company.
Greet pitee was it, as it thoughte hem alle,
Great pity was it, as it seemed to them all,
That evere swich a chaunce sholde falle,
That ever such a misfortune should occur,
For gentil men they were of greet estaat,
For they were gentle men of high rank,
And no thyng but for love was this debaat;
And this debate was for nothing but love;
And saugh hir blody woundes wyde and soore,
And saw their bloody wounds wide and sore,
And alle crieden, bothe lasse and moore,
And all cried, both low ranking and high,
"Have mercy, Lord, upon us wommen alle!"
"Have mercy, Lord, upon all of us women!"
And on hir bare knees adoun they falle
And they fall down on their bare knees
And wolde have kist his feet ther as he stood;
And would have kissed his feet there where he stood;
Til at the laste aslaked was his mood,
Until at the last his mood was calmed,
For pitee renneth soone in gentil herte.
For pity comes soon to a gentle heart.
And though he first for ire quook and sterte,
And though he first for anger shook and trembled,
He hath considered shortly, in a clause,
He has considered shortly, in brief,
The trespas of hem bothe, and eek the cause,
The trespass of them both, and also the cause,
And although that his ire hir gilt accused,
And although his anger reproached them for their guilt,
Yet in his resoun he hem bothe excused,
Yet in his reason he excused them both,
As thus: he thoghte wel that every man
As thus: he thought well that every man
Wol helpe hymself in love, if that he kan,
Will help himself in love, if he can,
And eek delivere hymself out of prisoun.
And also deliver himself out of prison.
And eek his herte hadde compassioun
And also his heart had compassion
Of wommen, for they wepen evere in oon,
Of women, for they weep continually,
And in his gentil herte he thoughte anon,
And in his gentle heart he thought straightway,
And softe unto hymself he seyde, "Fy
And softly to himself he said, "Fie
Upon a lord that wol have no mercy,
Upon a lord that will have no mercy,
But been a leon, bothe in word and dede,
But be a lion, both in word and deed,
To hem that been in repentaunce and drede,
To those who are in repentance and fear,
As wel as to a proud despitous man
As well as to a proud, spiteful man
That wol mayntene that he first bigan.
Who will persist in what he first began.
That lord hath litel of discrecioun,
That lord has little sound judgment,
That in swich cas kan no divisioun
That in such cases knows no distinctions
But weyeth pride and humblesse after oon."
But considers pride and humility equal."
And shortly, whan his ire is thus agoon,
And shortly, when his anger is thus gone,
He gan to looken up with eyen lighte
He began to look up with bright eyes
And spak thise same wordes al on highte:
And spoke these same words all aloud:
"The god of love, a benedicite!
"The god of love, ah, bless my soul!
How myghty and how greet a lord is he!
How mighty and how great a lord is he!
Ayeyns his myght ther gayneth none obstacles.
Against his power there avail no obstacles.
He may be cleped a god for his myracles,
He may be called a god for his miracles,
For he kan maken, at his owene gyse,
For he can make, as he pleases,
Of everich herte as that hym list divyse.
Of every heart whatever he wants to devise.
Lo heere this Arcite and this Palamoun,
Lo here this Arcite and this Palamon,
That quitly weren out of my prisoun,
Who freely were out of my prison,
And myghte han lyved in Thebes roially,
And could have lived royally in Thebes,
And witen I am hir mortal enemy,
And know I am their mortal enemy,
And that hir deth lith in my myght also,
And that their death lies in my power also,
And yet hath love, maugree hir eyen two,
And yet has Love, despite anything they could do,
Broght hem hyder bothe for to dye.
Brought them both hither to die.
Now looketh, is nat that an heigh folye?
Now look, is that not a great folly?
Who may been a fool but if he love?
Who can be a fool unless he is in love?
Bihoold, for Goddes sake that sit above,
Behold, for the sake of God who sits above,
Se how they blede! Be they noght wel arrayed?
See how they bleed! Are they not in fine condition?
Thus hath hir lord, the god of love, ypayed
Thus has their lord, the god of love, paid
Hir wages and hir fees for hir servyse!
Their wages and their fees for their service!
And yet they wenen for to been ful wyse
And yet they consider themselves very wise,
That serven love, for aught that may bifalle.
Those who serve love, whatever may happen.
But this is yet the beste game of alle,
But this is yet the best joke of all,
That she for whom they han this jolitee
That she for whom they have this sport
Kan hem therfore as muche thank as me.
Owes them as much gratitude for this as she owes me.
She woot namoore of al this hoote fare,
She knows no more of all this passionate business,
By God, than woot a cokkow or an hare!
By God, than knows a cuckoo or a hare!
But all moot ben assayed, hoot and coold;
But all must be tried, hot or cold;
A man moot ben a fool, or yong or oold --
A man must be a fool, either young or old --
I woot it by myself ful yore agon,
I know it by my own experience very long ago,
For in my tyme a servant was I oon.
For in my time I was a servant (of love).
And therfore, syn I knowe of loves peyne
And therefore, since I know of love's pain
And woot hou soore it kan a man distreyne,
And know how sorely it can afflict a man,
As he that hath ben caught ofte in his laas,
As one who has been often caught in its snare,
I yow foryeve al hoolly this trespaas,
I wholly forgive you this trespass,
At requeste of the queene, that kneleth heere,
At the request of the queen, who kneels here,
And eek of Emelye, my suster deere.
And also of Emelye, my dear sister.
And ye shul bothe anon unto me swere
And you must both immediately swear unto me
That nevere mo ye shal my contree dere,
That you shall never more harm my country,
Ne make werre upon me nyght ne day,
Nor make war upon me at any time,
But been my freendes in all that ye may.
But be my friends in all that you can.
I yow foryeve this trespas every deel."
I forgive you this trespass completely."
And they hym sworen his axyng faire and weel,
And they fairly and well swore to him (to do) his request,

At once, though you were to fight for evermore,
That oon of you, al be hym looth or lief,

Upon my word, and as I am a knight,

This is to say, that whether he or thou
May with his hundred, as I spak of now,

Sleen his contrarie, or out of lystes dryve,
Slay his opponent, or drive him out of the lists ,
Thanne shal I yeve Emelya to wyve
Then I shall give Emelye as wife
To whom that Fortune yeveth so fair a grace.

The portreiture that was upon the wal
The portraiture that was upon the wall
Withinne the temple of myghty Mars the rede?
Within the temple of mighty Mars the red?
Al peynted was the wal, in lengthe and brede,
All painted was the wall, in length and breadth,
Lyk to the estres of the grisly place
Like to the interior of the grisly place
That highte the grete temple of Mars in Trace,
That is called the Great Temple of Mars in Thrace,
In thilke colde, frosty regioun
In that same cold, frosty region
Ther as Mars hath his sovereyn mansioun.
Where Mars has his most excellent mansion.
First on the wal was peynted a forest,
First a forest was painted on the wall,
In which ther dwelleth neither man ne best,
In which there dwells neither man nor beast,
With knotty, knarry, bareyne trees olde,
With knotty, gnarled, barren old trees,
Of stubbes sharpe and hidouse to biholde,
Of stumps sharp and hideous to behold,
In which ther ran a rumbel in a swough,
Through which there ran a rumbling in a moaning of wind,
As though a storm sholde bresten every bough.
As though a storm should burst every bough.
And dounward from an hille, under a bente,
And downward from a hill, close to a grassy slope,
Ther stood the temple of Mars armypotente,
There stood the temple of Mars, powerful in arms,
Wroght al of burned steel, of which the entree
Wrought all of burnished steel, of which the entry
Was long and streit, and gastly for to se.
Was long and narrow, and frightening to look upon.
And therout came a rage and swich a veze
And out of there came a rush of wind and such a blast
That it made al the gate for to rese.
That it made all the gate to shake.
The northren lyght in at the dores shoon,
The northern light shone in at the doors,
For wyndowe on the wal ne was ther noon,
For there was no window on the wall,
Thurgh which men myghten any light discerne.
Through which men might discern any light.
The dore was al of adamant eterne,
The door was all of eternal adamant (hardest of stones),
Yclenched overthwart and endelong
Bound crosswise and lengthwise
With iren tough; and for to make it strong,
With tough iron; and to make it strong,
Every pyler, the temple to sustene,
Every pillar, to support the temple,
Was tonne-greet, of iren bright and shene.
Was big as a large barrel, (made) of iron bright and shining.

The smylere with the knyf under the cloke;
The smiler with the knife under the cloak;
The shepne brennynge with the blake smoke;
The stable burning with the black smoke;
The tresoun of the mordrynge in the bedde;
The treason of the murdering in the bed;
The open werre, with woundes al bibledde;

There yet I saw slayer of himself there --
His herte-blood hath bathed al his heer --

The nayl ydryven in the shode anyght;
The nail driven in the top of the head at night;
The colde deeth, with mouth gapyng upright.
The cold death, with mouth gaping upwards.
Amyddes of the temple sat Meschaunce,
Amidst the temple sat Misfortune,
With disconfort and sory contenaunce.
With grief and sorry countenance.

The sow devouring the child right in the cradle;
The cook yscalded, for al his longe ladel.

Under the wheel ful lowe he lay adoun.

The barbour, and the bocher, and the smyth,
The barber, and the butcher, and the smith,

Who forges sharp swords on his anvil.
And al above, depeynted in a tour,
And all above, painted in a tower,

Although at that same time they were unborn,
Yet was hir deth depeynted ther-biforn
Yet was their death depicted before then
By manasynge of Mars, right by figure;
By menacing of Mars, according to the horoscope;
So was it shewed in that portreiture,
So was it shown in that portraiture,
As is depeynted in the sterres above
As is depicted in the stars above
Who shal be slayn or elles deed for love.
Who shall be slain or else dead for love.

I can not recount them all even if I desired to.
The statue of Mars upon a carte stood
The statue of Mars stood upon a chariot
Armed, and looked grym as he were wood;
Armed, and looked as grim as if he were mad;

And over his head there shine two figures
Of sterres, that been cleped in scriptures,
Of stars, that are called in books,

In redoutynge of Mars and of his glorie.

Lygurge hymself, the grete kyng of Trace.
Lycurgus himself, the great king of Thrace.

The cercles of his eyen in his heed,
The circles of his eyes in his head,
They gloweden bitwixen yelow and reed,

And lik a grifphon looked he aboute,
And he looked about like a griffin (with an eagle's head),
With kempe heeris on his browes stoute;
With shaggy hairs on his stout brows;
His lymes grete, his brawnes harde and stronge,
His limbs large, his muscles hard and strong,

And as was the fashion in his country,
Ful hye upon a chaar of gold stood he,
He stood full high upon a chariot of gold,
With foure white boles in the trays.
With four white bulls in the traces.
In stede of cote-armure over his harnays,
Instead of a tunic with his coat of arms over his armor,
With nayles yelewe and brighte as any gold,
With claws yellow and bright as any gold,
He hadde a beres skyn, col-blak for old.
He had a bear's skin, coal-black because of age.
His longe heer was kembd bihynde his bak;
His long hair was combed behind his back;
As any ravenes fethere it shoon for blak;
Like any raven's feather it shone because of its blackness;
A wrethe of gold, arm-greet, of huge wighte,
A wreath of gold, thick as an arm, of huge weight,
Upon his heed, set ful of stones brighte,
Upon his head, set full of bright stones,
Of fyne rubyes and of dyamauntz.
Of fine rubies and of diamonds.
Aboute his chaar ther wenten white alauntz,
About his chariot there went white wolfhounds,
Twenty and mo, as grete as any steer,
Twenty and more, as big as any steer,
To hunten at the leoun or the deer,
To hunt for the lion or the deer,
And folwed hym with mosel faste ybounde,

Yet sang the lark) and Palamon right then
With hooly herte and with an heigh corage,

Thow gladere of the mount of Citheron,

Allas! I ne have no langage to telle

Myn herte may myne harmes nat biwreye;

But `Mercy, lady bright, that knowest weele

Considere al this and rewe upon my soore,

As wisly as I shal for everemoore,

Emforth my myght, thy trewe servant be,
According to my power (as much as I can), be thy true servant,
And holden werre alwey with chastitee.

That Arcita me thurgh the herte bere.

Thanne rekke I noght, whan I have lost my lyf,

Though that Arcita wynne hire to his wyf.

This is th'effect and ende of my preyere:

His sacrifice he dide, and that anon,
He did his sacrifice, and that quickly,
Ful pitously, with alle circumstaunces,
Full piteously, with all due ceremony,
Al telle I noght as now his observaunces;
Although I tell not now his observances;

But at the last the statue of Venus shook,
And made a signe, wherby that he took
And made a sign, whereby he understood

And with glad herte he wente hym hoom ful soone.
And with glad heart he went home very soon.
The thridde houre inequal that Palamon

Began to go to Venus' temple,
Up roos the sonne, and up roos Emelye
Up rose the sun, and up rose Emelye
And to the temple of Dyane gan hye.
And to the temple of Diana did hasten.
Hir maydens, that she thider with hire ladde,
Her maidens, whom she led thither with her,
Ful redily with hem the fyr they hadde,
They had the fire full readily with them,
Th'encens, the clothes, and the remenant al
The incense, the cloths, and all the rest
That to the sacrifice longen shal;
That is needed for the sacrifice;
The hornes fulle of meeth, as was the gyse --
The horns full of mead, as was the custom --
Ther lakked noght to doon hir sacrifise.
There lacked nothing (needed) to do her sacrifice.
Smokynge the temple, ful of clothes faire,
The temple smoking (with incense), full of fair cloths,
This Emelye, with herte debonaire,
This Emelye, with gentle heart,
Hir body wessh with water of a welle.
Washed her body with water of a well.
But hou she dide hir ryte I dar nat telle,
But how she did her rite I dare not tell,
But it be any thing in general;
Unless it be some thing in general;
And yet it were a game to heeren al.
And yet it would be a pleasure to hear all.
To hym that meneth wel it were no charge;
To one who means well it would be no matter of concern;
But it is good a man been at his large.
But it is good for a man to be without restriction (speak freely).
Hir brighte heer was kembd, untressed al;
Her bright hair was combed, all loose;
A coroune of a grene ook cerial
A crown of an evergreen oak
Upon hir heed was set ful fair and meete.
Was set upon her head full fair and suitable.
Two fyres on the auter gan she beete,
Two fires on the altar did she kindle,
And dide hir thynges, as men may biholde
And did her duties, as men can behold
In Stace of Thebes and thise bookes olde.
In Statius' Thebaid and such old books.
Whan kyndled was the fyr, with pitous cheere
When the fire was kindled, with a pitiful expression
Unto Dyane she spak as ye may heere:
Unto Diana she spoke as you may hear:
"O chaste goddesse of the wodes grene,
"O chaste goddess of the green woods,
To whom bothe hevene and erthe and see is sene,
To whom both heaven and earth and sea is visible,
Queene of the regne of Pluto derk and lowe,
Queen of the dark and low reign of Pluto,
Goddesse of maydens, that myn herte hast knowe
Goddess of maidens, whom my heart hast known
Ful many a yeer, and woost what I desire,
Full many a year, and knowest what I desire,
As keepe me fro thy vengeaunce and thyn ire,
Keep me from thy vengeance and thy ire,
That Attheon aboughte cruelly.
Which Acteon paid for cruelly.
Chaste goddesse, wel wostow that I
Chaste goddess, well knowest thou that I
Desire to ben a mayden al my lyf,
Desire to be a maiden all my life,
Ne nevere wol I be no love ne wyf.
Nor never will I be no lover nor wife.
I am, thow woost, yet of thy compaignye,
I am, thou knowest, yet of thy company,
A mayde, and love huntynge and venerye,
A maiden, and love hunting and the chase,
And for to walken in the wodes wilde,
And to walk in the wild woods,
And noght to ben a wyf and be with childe.
And not to be a wife and be with child.
Noght wol I knowe compaignye of man.
I do not desire to know company of man.
Now help me, lady, sith ye may and kan,
Now help me, lady, since you can and know how,
For tho thre formes that thou hast in thee.
For those three forms that thou hast in thee.
And Palamon, that hath swich love to me,
And Palamon, that has such love to me,
And eek Arcite, that loveth me so soore,
And also Arcite, who loves me so painfully,
This grace I preye thee withoute moore,
This grace I pray thee and ask no more,
As sende love and pees bitwixe hem two,
Send love and peace between them two,
And fro me turne awey hir hertes so
And turn away their hearts from me so
That al hire hoote love and hir desir,
That all their hot love and their desire,
And al hir bisy torment, and hir fir
And all their intense torment, and their fire
Be queynt, or turned in another place.
Will be quenched, or turned to another place.
And if so be thou wolt nat do me grace,
And if it so be thou wilt not do me grace,
Or if my destynee be shapen so
Or if my destiny is shaped so
That I shal nedes have oon of hem two,
That I must by necessity have one of them two,
As sende me hym that moost desireth me.
Send me him who most desires me.
Bihoold, goddesse of clene chastitee,
Behold, goddess of clean chastity,
The bittre teeris that on my chekes falle.
The bitter tears that fall on my cheeks.
Syn thou art mayde and kepere of us alle,
Since thou art maiden and guardian of us all,
My maydenhede thou kepe and wel conserve,
Thou care for and well conserve my maidenhood,
And whil I lyve, a mayde I wol thee serve."
And while I live, as a maiden I will serve thee."
The fires brenne upon the auter cleere,
The fires burn brightly upon the altar,
Whil Emelye was thus in hir preyere.
While Emelye was thus in her prayer.
But sodeynly she saugh a sighte queynte,
But suddenly she saw a curious sight,
For right anon oon of the fyres queynte
For right away one of the fires quenched
And quyked agayn, and after that anon
And rekindled again, and after that straightway
That oother fyr was queynt and al agon;
That other fire was quenched and all gone;
And as it queynte it made a whistelynge,
And as it quenched it made a roaring sound,
As doon thise wete brondes in hir brennynge,
As these wet brands do in their burning,
And at the brondes ende out ran anon
And at the brand's end (the fire) ran out straightway
As it were blody dropes many oon;
As if it were many bloody drops;
For which so soore agast was Emelye
For which so sorely frightened was Emelye
That she was wel ny mad and gan to crye,
That she was well nigh mad and began to cry,
For she ne wiste what it signyfied,
For she did not know what it signified,
But oonly for the feere thus hath she cried,
But simply for fear has she cried thus,
And weep that it was pitee for to heere.
And wept that it was a pity to hear.
And therwithal Dyane gan appeere,
And right then Diana did appear,
With bowe in honde, right as an hunteresse,
With bow in hand, just like a huntress,
And seyde, "Doghter, stynt thyn hevynesse.
And said, "Daughter, cease thy sadness.
Among the goddes hye it is affermed,
Among the high gods it is affirmed,
And by eterne word writen and confermed,
And by eternal word written and confirmed,
Thou shalt ben wedded unto oon of tho
Thou shalt be wedded unto one of those
That han for thee so muchel care and wo,
Who have for thee so much care and woe,
But unto which of hem I may nat telle.
But unto which of them I may not tell.
Farwel, for I ne may no lenger dwelle.
Farwell, for I can stay no longer .
The fires which that on myn auter brenne
The fires which burn on my altar
Shulle thee declaren, er that thou go henne,
Shall declare to thee, before thou go hence,
Thyn aventure of love, as in this cas."
Thy destiny concerning love, as in this situation."
And with that word, the arwes in the caas
And with that word, the arrows in the quiver
Of the goddesse clateren faste and rynge,
Of the goddess clatter fast and ring,
And forth she wente and made a vanysshynge;
And forth she went and vanished;
For which this Emelye astoned was,
For which this Emelye was astonished,
And seyde, "What amounteth this, allas?
And said, "What does this mean, alas?
I putte me in thy proteccioun,
I put me in thy protection,
Dyane, and in thy disposicioun."
Diana, and in thy power."
And hoom she goth anon the nexte weye.
And home she goes at once the nearest way.
This is th'effect; ther is namoore to seye.
This is the substance; there is no more to say.
The nexte houre of Mars folwynge this,
The next (planetary) hour of Mars following this,
Arcite unto the temple walked is
Arcite has walked unto the temple
Of fierse Mars to doon his sacrifise,
Of fierce Mars to do his sacrifice,
With alle the rytes of his payen wyse.
With all the rites of his pagan manner (of worship).
With pitous herte and heigh devocioun,
With sorrowful heart and intense devotion,
Right thus to Mars he seyde his orisoun:
Right thus to Mars he said his prayer:
"O stronge god, that in the regnes colde
"O strong god, who in the cold reigns
Of Trace honoured art and lord yholde,
Of Thrace art honored and considered lord,
And hast in every regne and every lond
And hast in every reign and every land
Of armes al the brydel in thyn hond,
All the control of arms in thy hand,
And hem fortunest as thee lyst devyse,
And grants them fortune as it pleases thee to command.
Accepte of me my pitous sacrifise.
Accept of me my sorrowful sacrifice.
If so be that my youthe may deserve,
If it so be that my youth may deserve,
And that my myght be worthy for to serve
And that my power be worthy to serve
Thy godhede, that I may been oon of thyne,
Thy godhead, so that I may be one of thine,
Thanne preye I thee to rewe upon my pyne.
Then pray I thee to have pity upon my pain.
For thilke peyne and thilke hoote fir
For that same pain and that same hot fire
In which thow whilom brendest for desir,
In which thou once burned for desire,
Whan that thow usedest the beautee
When that thou enjoyed the beauty
Of faire, yonge, fresshe Venus free,
Of fair, young, fresh Venus the noble,
And haddest hire in armes at thy wille --
And haddest her in arms as you wished --
Although thee ones on a tyme mysfille,
Although once things went wrong for you,
Whan Vulcanus hadde caught thee in his las
When Vulcan had caught thee in his snare
And foond thee liggynge by his wyf, allas! --
And found thee lying by his wife, alas! --
For thilke sorwe that was in thyn herte,
For that same sorrow that was in thy heart,
Have routhe as wel upon my peynes smerte.
Have pity as well upon my painful sufferings.
I am yong and unkonnynge, as thow woost,
I am young and ignorant, as thou knowest,
And, as I trowe, with love offended moost
And, as I suppose, injured most by love
That evere was any lyves creature,
Than ever was any living creature,
For she that dooth me al this wo endure
For she that causes me to endure all this woe
Ne reccheth nevere wher I synke or fleete.
Nor cares never whether I sink or swim.
And wel I woot, er she me mercy heete,
And well I know, before she may promise me mercy,
I moot with strengthe wynne hire in the place,
I must win her with strength in the lists,
And wel I woot, withouten help or grace
And well I know, without help or grace
Of thee ne may my strengthe noght availle.
Of thee my strength can not avail.
Thanne help me, lord, tomorwe in my bataille,
Then help me, lord, tomorrow in my battle,
For thilke fyr that whilom brente thee,
For that same fire that once burned thee,
As wel as thilke fyr now brenneth me,
As well as that same fire now burns me,
And do that I tomorwe have victorie.
And bring it about so that I have victory tomorrow.
Myn be the travaille, and thyn be the glorie!
Mine be the labor, and thine be the glory!
Thy sovereyn temple wol I moost honouren
I will most honor thy most excellent temple
Of any place, and alwey moost labouren
Over any place, and always most labor
In thy plesaunce and in thy craftes stronge,
In thy pleasure and in thy strong crafts,
And in thy temple I wol my baner honge
And in thy temple I will hang my banner
And alle the armes of my compaignye,
And all the arms of my company,
And everemo, unto that day I dye,
And evermore, until that day I die,
Eterne fir I wol bifore thee fynde.
Eternal fire I will provide before thee (on your altar).
And eek to this avow I wol me bynde:
And also I will bind myself to this vow:
My beerd, myn heer, that hongeth long adoun,
My beard, my hair, that hangs long down,
That nevere yet ne felte offensioun
That never yet felt injury
Of rasour nor of shere, I wol thee yive,
Of razor nor of shears, I will give thee,
And ben thy trewe servant whil I lyve.
And be thy true servant while I live.
Now, lord, have routhe upon my sorwes soore;
Now, lord, have pity upon my painful sorrows;
Yif me [victorie]; I aske thee namoore."
Give me victory; I ask of thee no more."
The preyere stynt of Arcita the stronge,
The prayer of Arcite the strong stopped,
The rynges on the temple dore that honge,
The rings that hung on the temple door,
And eek the dores, clatereden ful faste,
And also the doors, clattered very fast,
Of which Arcita somwhat hym agaste.
Of which Arcite was somewhat afraid.
The fyres brenden upon the auter brighte
The fires upon the altar burned (so) brightly
That it gan al the temple for to lighte;
That it began to illuminate all the temple;
A sweete smel the ground anon up yaf,
A sweet smell the ground at once yielded up,
And Arcita anon his hand up haf,
And Arcite immediately raised up his hand,
And moore encens into the fyr he caste,
And he cast more incense into the fire,
With othere rytes mo; and atte laste
With more other rites; and at the last
The statue of Mars bigan his hauberk rynge,
The statue of Mars began to ring its coat of mail,
And with that soun he herde a murmurynge
And with that sound he heard a murmuring
Ful lowe and dym, and seyde thus, "Victorie!"
Very low and faint, that said thus, "Victory!"
For which he yaf to Mars honour and glorie.
For which he (Arcite) gave to Mars honor and glory.
And thus with joye and hope wel to fare
And thus with joy and hope to fare well
Arcite anon unto his in is fare,
Arcite at once is gone unto his lodging,
As fayn as fowel is of the brighte sonne.
As happy as a fowl is for the bright sun.
And right anon swich strif ther is bigonne,
And right away such strife there is begun,
For thilke grauntyng, in the hevene above,
Because of that same grant, in the heaven above,
Bitwixe Venus, the goddesse of love,
Between Venus, the goddess of love,
And Mars, the stierne god armypotente,
And Mars, the stern god powerful in arms,
That Juppiter was bisy it to stente,
That Jupiter was hard put to stop it,
Til that the pale Saturnus the colde,
Until the pale Saturn the hostile,
That knew so manye of aventures olde,
Who knew so many of old adventures,
Foond in his olde experience an art
Found in his old experience a plan
That he ful soone hath plesed every part.
That he full soon has pleased every side.
As sooth is seyd, elde hath greet avantage;
As is truly said, old age has a great advantage;
In elde is bothe wysdom and usage;
In old age is both wisdom and experience;
Men may the olde atrenne and noght atrede.
One can outrun the old but not outwit them.
Saturne anon, to stynten strif and drede,
Saturn anon, to stop strife and fear,
Al be it that it is agayn his kynde,
Although it is against his natural disposition,
Of al this strif he gan remedie fynde.
He found a remedy for all this strife.
"My deere doghter Venus," quod Saturne,
"My dear daughter Venus," said Saturn,
"My cours, that hath so wyde for to turne,
"My orbit, that has so wide (a course) to turn,
Hath moore power than woot any man.
Has more power than any man knows.
Myn is the drenchyng in the see so wan;
Mine is the drowning in the sea so dark;
Myn is the prison in the derke cote;
Mine is the imprisonment in the dark cell;
Myn is the stranglyng and hangyng by the throte,
Mine is the killing and hanging by the throat,
The murmure and the cherles rebellyng,
The murmur (of discontent) and the churls' rebelling,
The groynynge, and the pryvee empoysonyng;
The grumbling, and the secret poisoning;
I do vengeance and pleyn correccioun,
I exact vengeance and do full punishment,
Whil I dwelle in the signe of the leoun.
While I dwell in the (zodiacal) sign of the lion.
Myn is the ruyne of the hye halles,
Mine is the ruin of the high halls,
The fallynge of the toures and of the walles
The falling of the towers and of the walls
Upon the mynour or the carpenter.
Upon the miner or the carpenter.
I slow Sampsoun, shakynge the piler;
I slew Sampson, shaking the pillar;
And myne be the maladyes colde,
And mine are the cold maladies,
The derke tresons, and the castes olde;
The dark treasons, and the old plots;
My lookyng is the fader of pestilence.
My (astrological) aspect is the father of pestilence.
Now weep namoore; I shal doon diligence
Now weep no more; I shall do my diligence
That Palamon, that is thyn owene knyght,
So that Palamon, who is thine own knight,
Shal have his lady, as thou hast him hight.
Shall have his lady, as thou hast promised him.
Though Mars shal helpe his knyght, yet nathelees
Though Mars shall help his knight, yet nonetheless
Bitwixe yow ther moot be som tyme pees,
Between you there must be peace sometime,
Al be ye noght of o compleccioun,
Although you are not of one (the same) temperament,
That causeth al day swich divisioun.
Which daily causes such dissension.
I am thyn aiel, redy at thy wille;
I am thy grandfather, ready (to do) as you wish;
Weep now namoore; I wol thy lust fulfille."
Weep now no more; I will fulfill thy desire."
Now wol I stynten of the goddes above,
Now I will stop (speaking) of the gods above,
Of Mars, and of Venus, goddesse of love,
Of Mars, and of Venus, goddess of love,
And telle yow as pleynly as I kan
And tell you as plainly as I can
The grete effect, for which that I bygan.
The essential part, for which I began.
Greet was the feeste in Atthenes that day,
Great was the feast in Athens that day,
And eek the lusty seson of that May
And also the pleasing season of that May
Made every wight to been in swich plesaunce
Made every person to be in such delight
That al that Monday justen they and daunce,
That all that Monday they joust and dance,
And spenden it in Venus heigh servyse.
And spend that day in Venus's noble service.
But by the cause that they sholde ryse
But because they must rise
Eerly, for to seen the grete fight,
Early, to see the great fight,
Unto hir reste wenten they at nyght.
Unto their rest they went at nightfall.
And on the morwe, whan that day gan sprynge,
And in the morning, when day did spring,
Of hors and harneys noyse and claterynge
Noise and clattering of horses and armor
Ther was in hostelryes al aboute,
There was in hostelries all about,
And to the paleys rood ther many a route
And to the palace there rode many a company
Of lordes upon steedes and palfreys.
Of lords upon steeds and palfreys.
Ther maystow seen devisynge of harneys
There canst thou see preparation of armor
So unkouth and so riche, and wroght so weel
So exotic and so rich, and wrought so well
Of goldsmythrye, of browdynge, and of steel;
Of goldsmiths' works, of embroidery, and of steel;
The sheeldes brighte, testeres, and trappures,
The bright shields, horses' head-armor, and horse-armor,
Gold-hewen helmes, coats of mail, cote-armures;
Gold-colored helms, coats of mail, tunics with heraldic devices;
Lordes in parementz on hir courseres,
Lords in richly decorated robes on their coursers,
Knyghtes of retenue, and eek squieres
Knights of (their) retinues, and also squires
Nailynge the speres, and helmes bokelynge;
Nailing heads to the spear-shafts, and buckling helms;
Giggynge of sheeldes, with layneres lacynge --
Fitting the shields with straps, fastening with laces --
There as nede is they weren no thyng ydel;
Where it is needed they were not at all idle;
The fomy steedes on the golden brydel
The steeds frothing on the golden bridles
Gnawynge, and faste the armurers also
Gnawing, and fast the armorers also
With fyle and hamer prikynge to and fro;
With file and hammer are spurring to and fro;
Yemen on foote, and communes many oon
Yeomen on foot, and foot soldiers many a one
With shorte staves, thikke as they may goon;
With short staves, thick as they can go;
Pypes, trompes, nakers, clariounes,
Pipes, trumpets, kettle drums, bugles,
That in the bataille blowen blody sounes;
That blow bloody sounds in the battle;
The paleys ful of peple up and doun,
The palace full of people everywhere,
Heere thre, ther ten, holdynge hir questioun,
Here three, there ten, debating,
Dyvynynge of thise Thebane knyghtes two.
Conjecturing about these two Theban knights.
Somme seyden thus, somme seyde "it shal be so";
Some said thus, some said "it shall be so";
Somme helden with hym with the blake berd,
Some held with him with the black beard,
Somme with the balled, somme with the thikke herd;
Some with the bald, some with the thickly haired;
Somme seyde he looked grymme, and he wolde fighte:
Some said he looked grim, and he would fight:
"He hath a sparth of twenty pound of wighte."
"He has a battle-ax of twenty pounds of weight."
Thus was the halle ful of divynynge,
Thus was the hall full of conjecturing,
Longe after that the sonne gan to sprynge.
Long after the sun began to rise.
The grete Theseus, that of his sleep awaked
The great Theseus, who was awakened of his sleep
With mynstralcie and noyse that was maked,
By the music and noise that was made,
Heeld yet the chambre of his paleys riche
Remained yet in the chamber of his rich palace
Til that the Thebane knyghtes, bothe yliche
Until the Theban knights, both equally
Honured, were into the paleys fet.
Honored, were fetched into the palace.
Duc Theseus was at a wyndow set,
Duke Theseus was set at a window,
Arrayed right as he were a god in trone.
Arrayed exactly as if he were a god on a throne.
The peple preesseth thiderward ful soone
The people press thither full soon
Hym for to seen, and doon heigh reverence,
In order to see him, and to do great reverence,
And eek to herkne his heste and his sentence.
And also to hear his command and his decision.
An heraud on a scaffold made an "Oo!"
A herald on a scaffold made a "Ho!"
Til al the noyse of peple was ydo,
Until all the noise of people was done,
And whan he saugh the peple of noyse al stille,
And when he saw the people all still of noise,
Tho shewed he the myghty dukes wille:
Then showed he the mighty duke's will:
"The lord hath of his heigh discrecioun
"The lord has of his great sound judgment
Considered that it were destruccioun
Considered that it would be destruction
To gentil blood to fighten in the gyse
To gentle blood to fight in the manner
Of mortal bataille now in this emprise.
Of mortal battle now in this undertaking.
Wherfore, to shapen that they shal nat dye,
Wherefore, to arrange matters so that they shall not die,
He wol his firste purpos modifye.
He will modify his previous plan.
No man therfore, up peyne of los of lyf,
No man therefore, upon punishment of loss of life,
No maner shot, ne polax, ne short knyf
No sort of arrow, nor battle-axe, nor short knife
Into the lystes sende or thider brynge;
Send into the lists or bring there;
Ne short swerd, for to stoke with poynt bitynge,
Nor short sword, to stab with piercing point,
No man ne drawe, ne bere it by his syde.
May no man neither draw, nor bear it by his side.
Ne no man shal unto his felawe ryde
And no man shall ride at his opponent
But o cours with a sharpe ygrounde spere;
More than one course with a sharply honed spear;
Foyne, if hym list, on foote, hymself to were.
Let him thrust, if he wishes, on foot, to defend himself.
And he that is at meschief shal be take
And he who is at a disadvantage shall be taken
And noght slayn, but be broght unto the stake
And not slain, but be brought unto the stake
That shal ben ordeyned on either syde;
That shall be placed on either side;
But thider he shal by force, and there abyde.
But thither he must (go) by force, and remain there.
And if so falle the chieftayn be take
And if so happen that the chieftain be taken
On outher syde, or elles sleen his make,
On either side, or else should slay his opponent,
No lenger shal the turneiynge laste.
The tournament shall last no longer.
God spede you! Gooth forth and ley on faste!
God give you success! Go forth and lay on fast!
With long swerd and with mace fighteth youre fille.
With long sword and with mace fight your fill.
Gooth now youre wey; this is the lordes wille."
Go now on your way; this is the lord's will."
The voys of peple touchede the hevene,
The voice of people touched the heaven,
So loude cride they with murie stevene,
So loudly they cried with merry voices,
"God save swich a lord, that is so good
"God save such a lord, that is so good
He wilneth no destruccion of blood!"
He desires no destruction of blood!"
Up goon the trompes and the melodye,
Up go the trumpets and the melody,
And to the lystes rit the compaignye,
And to the lists rides the company,
By ordinance, thurghout the citee large,
In battle array, throughout all the city,
Hanged with clooth of gold, and nat with sarge.
Hung with cloth of gold, and not with serge.
Ful lik a lord this noble duc gan ryde,
Fully like a lord this noble duke did ride,
Thise two Thebans upon either syde,
These two Thebans upon either side,
And after rood the queene and Emelye,
And after rode the queen and Emelye,
And after that another compaignye
And after that another company
Of oon and oother, after hir degree.
One after another, according to their rank.
And thus they passen thurghout the citee,
And thus they pass throughout the city,
And to the lystes come they by tyme.
And they come to the lists in good time.
It nas nat of the day yet fully pryme
It was not yet fully prime (nine a.m.) of the day
Whan set was Theseus ful riche and hye,
When Theseus was set very splendidly and nobly,
Ypolita the queene, and Emelye,
Ypolita the queen, and Emelye,
And othere ladys in degrees aboute.
And other ladies about in tiers.
Unto the seetes preesseth al the route.
Unto the seats press all the crowd.
And westward, thurgh the gates under Marte,
And westward, through the gates under Mars,
Arcite, and eek the hondred of his parte,
Arcite, and also the hundred of his party,
With baner reed is entred right anon;
With red banner is entered right away;
And in that selve moment Palamon
And in that same moment Palamon
Is under Venus, estward in the place,
Is under Venus, eastward in the place,
With baner whyt and hardy chiere and face.
With white banner and hardy countenance and face.
In al the world, to seken up and doun,
In all the world, to seek up and down,
So evene, withouten variacioun,
So evenly, without variation,
Ther nere swiche compaignyes tweye,
There were not two such companies,
For ther was noon so wys that koude seye
For there was no one so wise that could say
That any hadde of oother avauntage
That any one had advantage over the other
Of worthynesse, ne of estaat, ne age,
In worthiness, nor in status, nor age,
So evene were they chosen, for to gesse.
So evenly were they chosen, as I estimate.
And in two renges faire they hem dresse.
And in two fair ranks they arrange themselves.
Whan that hir names rad were everichon,
When every one of their names were read,
That in hir nombre gyle were ther noon,
So that in their total number there would be no deception,
Tho were the gates shet, and cried was loude:
Then the gates were shut, and cried was aloud:
"Do now youre devoir, yonge knyghtes proude!"
"Do now your duty, proud young knights!"
The heraudes lefte hir prikyng up and doun;
The heralds left their spurring up and down;
Now ryngen trompes loude and clarioun.
Now trumpets and bugles ring loud.
Ther is namoore to seyn, but west and est
There is no more to say, but from west and east
In goon the speres ful sadly in arrest;
In go the spears very firmly in the lance-rests;
In gooth the sharpe spore into the syde.
In goes the sharp spur into the flank.
Ther seen men who kan juste and who kan ryde;
There people see who can joust and who can ride;
Ther shyveren shaftes upon sheeldes thikke;
There splinter spears upon thick shields;
He feeleth thurgh the herte-spoon the prikke.
He feels the stabbing through the breast-bone.
Up spryngen speres twenty foot on highte;
Up spring spears twenty foot on height;
Out goon the swerdes as the silver brighte;
Out go the swords bright as silver;
The helmes they tohewen and toshrede;
The helms they hew to pieces and cut into shreds
Out brest the blood with stierne stremes rede;
Out burst the blood in strong red streams;
With myghty maces the bones they tobreste.
With mighty maces they break the bones to pieces.
He thurgh the thikkeste of the throng gan threste;
He did thrust through the thickest of the throng;
Ther stomblen steedes stronge, and doun gooth al,
There strong steeds stumble, and down goes all,
He rolleth under foot as dooth a bal;
He rolls under foot as does a ball;
He foyneth on his feet with his tronchoun,
On his feet he stabs with the broken shaft of his spear,
And he hym hurtleth with his hors adoun;
And he hurtles him down with his horse;
He thurgh the body is hurt and sithen ytake,
He is hurt through the body and then taken,
Maugree his heed, and broght unto the stake;
Despite all he can do, and brought unto the stake;
As forward was, right there he moste abyde.
As was the agreement, right there he must abide.
Another lad is on that oother syde.
Another on that other side is led away.
And some tyme dooth hem Theseus to reste,
And for a while Theseus makes them rest,
Hem to refresshe and drynken, if hem leste.
To refresh themselves and drink, if they wish.
Ful ofte a day han thise Thebanes two
Many times these two Thebans have
Togydre ymet, and wroght his felawe wo;
Met together, and (each) wrought woe to his opponent;
Unhorsed hath ech oother of hem tweye.
Each has unhorsed the other of them two.
Ther nas no tygre in the vale of Galgopheye,
There was not any tiger in the vale of Gargaphia,
Whan that hir whelp is stole whan it is lite,
When her whelp is stolen when it is little,
So crueel on the hunte as is Arcite
So cruel on the hunt as is Arcite
For jelous herte upon this Palamon.
For jealous heart upon this Palamon.
Ne in Belmarye ther nys so fel leon,
Nor in Benmarin there is not so fierce a lion,
That hunted is, or for his hunger wood,
That is hunted, or maddened by his hunger,
Ne of his praye desireth so the blood,
Nor of his prey desires so the blood,
As Palamon to sleen his foo Arcite.
As Palamon to slay his foe Arcite.
The jelous strokes on hir helmes byte;
The fervent strokes bite on their helms;
Out renneth blood on bothe hir sydes rede.
Out runs red blood on both their sides.
Som tyme an ende ther is of every dede.
Some time there is an end of every deed.
For er the sonne unto the reste wente,
For before the sun went unto its rest,
The stronge kyng Emetreus gan hente
The strong king Emetreus did seize
This Palamon, as he faught with Arcite,
This Palamon, as he fought with Arcite,
And made his swerd depe in his flessh to byte,
And made his sword deep in his flesh to bite,
And by the force of twenty is he take
And by the force of twenty he (Palamon) is taken
Unyolden, and ydrawen to the stake.
Without having surrendered, and dragged to the stake.
And in the rescus of this Palamoun
And in the rescue of this Palamon
The stronge kyng Lygurge is born adoun,
The strong king Lygurge is born down,
And kyng Emetreus, for al his strengthe,
And king Emetreus, despite all his strength,
Is born out of his sadel a swerdes lengthe,
Is carried out of his saddle a sword's length,
So hitte him Palamoun er he were take.
So hit him Palamon before he was taken.
But al for noght; he was broght to the stake.
But all for naught; he was brought to the stake.
His hardy herte myghte hym helpe naught:
His hardy heart could not help him:
He moste abyde, whan that he was caught,
He must abide, when he was caught,
By force and eek by composicioun.
By force and also by the agreed terms of battle.
Who sorweth now but woful Palamoun,
Who sorrows now but woeful Palamon,
That moot namoore goon agayn to fighte?
That must no more go again to fight?
And whan that Theseus hadde seyn this sighte,
And when Theseus had seen this sight,
Unto the folk that foghten thus echon
Unto each one of the folk that fought thus
He cryde, "Hoo! namoore, for it is doon!
He cried, "Stop! no more, for it is done!
I wol be trewe juge, and no partie.
I will be true judge, and no partisan.
Arcite of Thebes shal have Emelie,
Arcite of Thebes shall have Emelye,
That by his fortune hath hire faire ywonne."
Who by his fortune has won her fairly."
Anon ther is a noyse of peple bigonne
Immediately there is a noise of people begun
For joye of this, so loude and heighe withalle
For joy of this, so loud and clamorous indeed
It semed that the lystes sholde falle.
It seemed that the lists should fall.
What kan now faire Venus doon above?
What now can fair Venus do above?
What seith she now? What dooth this queene of love,
What says she now? What does this queen of love,
But wepeth so, for wantynge of hir wille,
But weeps so, for lack of (having) her will,
Til that hir teeres in the lystes fille?
Until her tears fell in the lists?
She seyde, "I am ashamed, doutelees."
She said, "I am disgraced, doubtless."
Saturnus seyde, "Doghter, hoold thy pees!
Saturn said, "Daughter, hold thy peace!
Mars hath his wille, his knyght hath al his boone,
Mars has his will, his knight has all his request,
And, by myn heed, thow shalt been esed soone."
And, by my head, thou shalt be relieved soon."
The trompours, with the loude mynstralcie,
The trumpeters, with the loud music,
The heraudes, that ful loude yelle and crie,
The heralds, who full loudly yell and cry,
Been in hire wele for joye of daun Arcite.
Are in their happiest state for joy of dan Arcite.
But herkneth me, and stynteth noyse a lite,
But listen to me, and stop the noise for a little,
Which a myracle ther bifel anon.
(Hear) what a miracle at once befell there.
This fierse Arcite hath of his helm ydon,
This fierce Arcite has taken off his helm,
And on a courser, for to shewe his face,
And on a war horse, to show his face,
He priketh endelong the large place
He spurs from one end to the other of the large open space
Lokynge upward upon this Emelye;
Looking upward upon this Emelye;
And she agayn hym caste a freendlich ye
And she to him cast a friendly eye
(For wommen, as to speken in comune,
(For women, so to speak in general,
Thei folwen alle the favour of Fortune)
They all follow the favor of Fortune)
And was al his chiere, as in his herte.
And was all his source of pleasure, in his heart.
Out of the ground a furie infernal sterte,
Out of the ground leaped an infernal fury,
From Pluto sent at requeste of Saturne,
Sent from Pluto at the request of Saturn,
For which his hors for fere gan to turne,
For which his horse for fear began to turn,
And leep aside, and foundred as he leep;
And leaped aside, and stumbled as he leaped;
And er that Arcite may taken keep,
And before Arcite can take heed,
He pighte hym on the pomel of his heed,
He hit himself on the top of his head,
That in the place he lay as he were deed,
That in the place he lay as if he were dead,
His brest tobrosten with his sadel-bowe.
His breast shattered by his saddlebow.
As blak he lay as any cole or crowe,
He lay as black as any coal or crow,
So was the blood yronnen in his face.
The blood was so run in his face.
Anon he was yborn out of the place,
Immediately he was carried out of the place,
With herte soor, to Theseus paleys.
With painful heart, to Theseus's palace.
Tho was he korven out of his harneys
Then was he cut out of his armor
And in a bed ybrought ful faire and blyve,
And brought in a bed very gently and quickly,
For he was yet in memorie and alyve,
For he was yet conscious and alive,
And alwey criynge after Emelye.
And always crying for Emelye.
Duc Theseus, with al his compaignye,
Duke Theseus, with all his company,
Is comen hoom to Atthenes his citee,
Is come home to Athens, his city,
With alle blisse and greet solempnitee.
With all bliss and great solemnity.
Al be it that this aventure was falle,
Although this accident had happened,
He nolde noght disconforten hem alle.
He would not distress them all.
Men seyde eek that Arcite shal nat dye;
People said also that Arcite shall not dye;
He shal been heeled of his maladye.
He shall be healed of his injuries.
And of another thyng they weren as fayn,
And of another thing they were as happy,
That of hem alle was ther noon yslayn,
That of them all there was no one slain,
Al were they soore yhurt, and namely oon,
Although they (were) sorely hurt, and especially one,
That with a spere was thirled his brest boon.
Whose breastbone was pierced by a spear.
To othere woundes and to broken armes
To other wounds and to broken arms
Somme hadden salves, and somme hadden charmes;
Some had salves, and some had charms;
Fermacies of herbes, and eek save
Medicines made of herbs, and also of sage
They dronken, for they wolde hir lymes have.
They drank, for they wanted to have their limbs cured.
For which this noble duc, as he wel kan,
For which this noble duke, as he well knows how,
Conforteth and honoureth every man,
Comforts and honors every man,
And made revel al the longe nyght
And made revel all the long night
Unto the straunge lordes, as was right.
For the foreign lords, as was right.
Ne ther was holden no disconfitynge
Nor was it considered any defeat (in battle)
But as a justes or a tourneiynge;
But (only) as a joust or a tournament;
For soothly ther was no disconfiture.
For truly there was no defeat.
For fallyng nys nat but an aventure,
For falling is nothing but an accident,
Ne to be lad by force unto the stake
Nor to be led by force unto the stake
Unyolden, and with twenty knyghtes take,
Without having surrendered, and taken by twenty knights,
O persone allone, withouten mo,
One person alone, without others,
And haryed forth by arme, foot, and too,
And dragged forth by arm, foot, and toe,
And eke his steede dryven forth with staves
And also his steed driven forth with staves
With footmen, bothe yemen and eek knaves --
By men on foot, both yeomen and also foot soldiers --
It nas arretted hym no vileynye;
He incurred no shameful blame for it;
Ther may no man clepen it cowardye.
No man there may call it cowardice.
For which anon duc Theseus leet crye,
For which anon duke Theseus had proclaimed,
To stynten alle rancour and envye,
To put a stop to all rancor and ill-will,
The gree as wel of o syde as of oother,
The victory (is given) as well to one side as to the other,
And eyther syde ylik as ootheres brother;
And either side equal as the other's brother;
And yaf hem yiftes after hir degree,
And gave them gifts in accordance with their ranks,
And fully heeld a feeste dayes three,
And held a feast for fully three days,
And conveyed the kynges worthily
And honorably escorted the kings
Out of his toun a journee largely.
Out of his town a full day's journey.
And hoom wente every man the righte way.
And home went every man the direct way.
Ther was namoore but "Fare wel, have good day!"
There was no more but "Fare well, have good day!"
Of this bataille I wol namoore endite,
Of this battle I will write no more,
But speke of Palamon and of Arcite.
But speak of Palamon and of Arcite.
Swelleth the brest of Arcite, and the soore
The breast of Arcite swells, and the pain
Encreesseth at his herte moore and moore.
At his heart increases more and more.
The clothered blood, for any lechecraft,
The clotted blood, despite any medical treatment,
Corrupteth, and is in his bouk ylaft,
Corrupts, and is left in the trunk of his body,
That neither veyne-blood, ne ventusynge,
That neither blood letting at a vein, nor applying suction cups,
Ne drynke of herbes may ben his helpynge.
Nor drink of herbs can be any help to him.
The vertu expulsif, or animal,
The power expulsive (to expel fluids), or animal,
Fro thilke vertu cleped natural
From that power called natural
Ne may the venym voyden ne expelle.
Can not remove nor expel the poison.
The pipes of his longes gonne to swelle,
The pipes of his lungs began to swell,
And every lacerte in his brest adoun
And every muscle down in his breast
Is shent with venym and corrupcioun.
Is destroyed by poison and corrupted matter.
Hym gayneth neither, for to gete his lif,
Avails him neither, to preserve his life,
Vomyt upward, ne dounward laxatif.
Vomit upward, nor downward laxative.
Al is tobrosten thilke regioun;
All is shattered in that region;
Nature hath now no dominacioun.
Nature now has no power to control.
And certeinly, ther Nature wol nat wirche,
And certainly, where Nature will not work,
Fare wel phisik! Go ber the man to chirche!
Fare well medicine! Go bear the man to church!
This al and som, that Arcita moot dye;
This is the whole of it, that Arcite must die;
For which he sendeth after Emelye,
For which he sends after Emelye,
And Palamon, that was his cosyn deere.
And Palamon, who was his dear cousin.
Thanne seyde he thus, as ye shal after heere:
Then said he thus, as you shall after hear:
"Naught may the woful spirit in myn herte
"The woeful spirit in my heart can not
Declare o point of alle my sorwes smerte
Declare one small part of all my painful sorrows
To yow, my lady, that I love moost,
To you, my lady, whom I love most,
But I biquethe the servyce of my goost
But I bequeath the service of my ghost
To yow aboven every creature,
To you above every creature,
Syn that my lyf may no lenger dure.
Since my life can no longer endure.
Allas, the wo! Allas, the peynes stronge,
Alas, the woe! Alas, the strong pains,
That I for yow have suffred, and so longe!
That I have suffered for you, and so long!
Allas, the deeth! Allas, myn Emelye!
Alas, the death! Alas, my Emelye!
Allas, departynge of oure compaignye!
Alas, separation of our company!
Allas, myn hertes queene! Allas, my wyf,
Alas, my heart's queen! Alas, my wife,
Myn hertes lady, endere of my lyf!
My heart's lady, ender of my life!
What is this world? What asketh men to have?
What is this world? What do people ask to have?
Now with his love, now in his colde grave
Now with his love, now in his cold grave
Allone, withouten any compaignye.
Alone, without any company.
Fare wel, my sweete foo, myn Emelye!
Fare well, my sweet foe, my Emelye!
And softe taak me in youre armes tweye,
And softly take me in your two arms,
For love of God, and herkneth what I seye.
For love of God, and listen to what I say.
"I have heer with my cosyn Palamon
"I have here with my cousin Palamon
Had strif and rancour many a day agon
Had strife and rancor many a day ago
For love of yow, and for my jalousye.
For love of you, and for my jealousy.
And Juppiter so wys my soule gye,
And as Jupiter may guide my soul,
To speken of a servaunt proprely,
To speak specifically of a servant (of love),
With alle circumstances trewely --
With all the attendant attributes truly --
That is to seyen, trouthe, honour, knyghthede,
That is to say, truth, honor, knighthood,
Wysdom, humblesse, estaat, and heigh kynrede,
Wisdom, humbleness, rank, and noble ancestry,
Fredom, and al that longeth to that art --
Nobility of character, and all that belongs to that art --
So Juppiter have of my soule part,
As Jupiter may have concern for my soul,
As in this world right now ne knowe I non
In this world right now I know no one
So worthy to ben loved as Palamon,
So worthy to be loved as Palamon,
That serveth yow, and wol doon al his lyf.
Who serves you, and will do so all his life.
And if that evere ye shul ben a wyf,
And if ever you shall be a wife,
Foryet nat Palamon, the gentil man."
Forget not Palamon, the gentle man."
And with that word his speche faille gan,
And with that word his speech began to fail,
For from his feet up to his brest was come
For from his feet up to his breast had come
The coold of deeth, that hadde hym overcome,
The cold of death, which had overcome him,
And yet mooreover, for in his armes two
And yet moreover, for in his two arms
The vital strengthe is lost and al ago.
The vital strength is lost and all gone.
Oonly the intellect, withouten moore,
Only the intellect, nothing else,
That dwelled in his herte syk and soore,
That dwelled in his heart sick and sore,
Gan faillen whan the herte felte deeth.
Began to fail when the heart felt death.
Dusked his eyen two, and failled breeth,
His two eyes grew dark, and his breath failed,
But on his lady yet caste he his ye;
But on his lady yet he cast his eye;
His laste word was, "Mercy, Emelye!"
His last word was, "Mercy, Emelye!"
His spirit chaunged hous and wente ther,
His spirit changed house and went where,
As I cam nevere, I kan nat tellen wher.
Since I came never (there), I can not tell where.
Therfore I stynte; I nam no divinistre;
Therefore I stop; I am no theologian;
Of soules fynde I nat in this registre,
I find nothing about souls in this register,
Ne me ne list thilke opinions to telle
Nor do I wish to tell such beliefs
Of hem, though that they writen wher they dwelle.
Of them, though they write of where they (the souls) dwell.
Arcite is coold, ther Mars his soule gye!
Arcite is cold, may Mars guide his soul!
Now wol I speken forth of Emelye.
Now will I speak forth of Emelye.
Shrighte Emelye, and howleth Palamon,
Emelye shrieked, and Palamon howls,
And Theseus his suster took anon
And Theseus immediately took his sister
Swownynge, and baar hire fro the corps away.
Swooning, and carried her away from the corpse.
What helpeth it to tarien forth the day
What helps it to waste the whole day
To tellen how she weep bothe eve and morwe?
To tell how she wept both evening and morning?
For in swich cas wommen have swich sorwe,
For in such cases women have such sorrow,
Whan that hir housbondes ben from hem ago,
When their husbands are gone from them,
That for the moore part they sorwen so,
That for the most part they so sorrow,
Or ellis fallen in swich maladye
Or else fall in such illness
That at the laste certeinly they dye.
That at the last certainly they die.
Infinite been the sorwes and the teeres
Infinite are the sorrows and the tears
Of olde folk and folk of tendre yeeres
Of old folk and folk of tender years
In al the toun for deeth of this Theban.
In all the town for the death of this Theban.
For hym ther wepeth bothe child and man;
For him there weep both child and man;
So greet wepyng was ther noon, certayn,
There was no such great weeping, certainly,
Whan Ector was ybroght, al fressh yslayn,
When Hector was brought, just recently slain,
To Troye. Allas, the pitee that was ther,
To Troy. Alas, the lamentation that was there,
Cracchynge of chekes, rentynge eek of heer.
Scratching of cheeks, also tearing of hair.
"Why woldestow be deed," thise wommen crye,
"Why wouldst thou be dead," these women cry,
"And haddest gold ynough, and Emelye?"
"Since thou haddest gold enough, and Emelye?"
No man myghte gladen Theseus,
No man might comfort Theseus,
Savynge his olde fader Egeus,
Except for his old father Egeus,
That knew this worldes transmutacioun,
Who knew the changes of this world,
As he hadde seyn it chaunge bothe up and doun,
As he had seen it change both up and down,
Joye after wo, and wo after gladnesse,
Joy after woe, and woe after gladness,
And shewed hem ensamples and liknesse.
And showed them examples and comparisons.
"Right as ther dyed nevere man," quod he,
"Right as there died never a man," said he,
"That he ne lyvede in erthe in some degree,
"Who did not live in earth to some extent
Right so ther lyvede never man," he seyde,
Just so there lived never a man," he said,
"In al this world, that som tyme he ne deyde.
"In all this world, who some time did not die.
This world nys but a thurghfare ful of wo,
This world is nothing but a thoroughfare full of woe,
And we been pilgrymes, passynge to and fro.
And we are pilgrims, passing to and fro.
Deeth is an ende of every worldly soore."
Death is an end of every worldly pain."
And over al this yet seyde he muchel moore
And beyond all this yet he said much more
To this effect, ful wisely to enhorte
To this effect, full wisely to exhort
The peple that they sholde hem reconforte.
The people that they should comfort themselves.
Duc Theseus, with al his bisy cure,
Duke Theseus, with all his careful attention,
Caste now wher that the sepulture
Considered now where the tomb
Of goode Arcite may best ymaked be,
Of good Arcite may best be made,
And eek moost honurable in his degree.
And also most honorable in (regard to) his rank.
And at the laste he took conclusioun
And at the last he concluded
That ther as first Arcite and Palamoun
That there where first Arcite and Palamon
Hadden for love the bataille hem bitwene,
Had the battle between them for love,
That in that selve grove, swoote and grene,
That in that same grove, sweet-smelling and green,
Ther as he hadde his amorouse desires,
Where he had his amorous desires,
His compleynte, and for love his hoote fires,
His lament, and for love his hot fires,
He wolde make a fyr in which the office
He would make a fire in which the rite
Funeral he myghte al accomplice.
Of a funeral he might fully perform.
And leet comande anon to hakke and hewe
And he ordered immediately to hack and hew
The okes olde, and leye hem on a rewe
The old oaks, and lay them in a row
In colpons wel arrayed for to brenne.
In piles arranged to burn well.
His officers with swifte feet they renne
His officers with swift feet they run
And ryde anon at his comandement.
And ride quickly at his commandment.
And after this, Theseus hath ysent
And after this, Theseus has sent
After a beere, and it al overspradde
For a bier, and it all overspread
With clooth of gold, the richeste that he hadde.
With cloth of gold, the richest that he had.
And of the same suyte he cladde Arcite;
And of the same material he clad Arcite;
Upon his hondes hadde he gloves white,
Upon his hands he had white gloves,
Eek on his heed a coroune of laurer grene,
Also on his head a crown of green laurel,
And in his hond a swerd ful bright and kene.
And in his hand a sword full bright and keen.
He leyde hym, bare the visage, on the beere;
He laid him, with the face bare, on the bier;
Therwith he weep that pitee was to heere.
Therewith he wept that it was a pity to hear.
And for the peple sholde seen hym alle,
And in order that all the people should see him,
Whan it was day, he broghte hym to the halle,
When it was day, he brought him to the hall,
That roreth of the criyng and the soun.
That resounds with the crying and the sound.
Tho cam this woful Theban Palamoun,
Then came this woeful Theban Palamon,
With flotery berd and ruggy, asshy heeres,
With waving beard and rough hair sprinkled with ashes,
In clothes blake, ydropped al with teeres;
In black clothes, all sprinkled with tears;
And, passynge othere of wepynge, Emelye,
And, excelling others in weeping, Emelye,
The rewefulleste of al the compaignye.
The most pitiful of all the company.
In as muche as the servyce sholde be
In order that the ritual should be
The moore noble and riche in his degree,
The more noble and rich in its degree,
Duc Theseus leet forth thre steedes brynge,
Duke Theseus had three steeds brought forth,
That trapped were in steel al gliterynge,
That were equipped with trappings of steel all glittering,
And covered with the armes of daun Arcite.

Upon these steeds, that were large and white,
Ther seten folk, of whiche oon baar his sheeld,
There sat folk, of which one carried his (Arcite's) shield,
Another his spere up on his hondes heeld,
Another held his spear upright in his hands,
The thridde baar with hym his bowe Turkeys
The third carried with him his Turkish bow
(Of brend gold was the caas and eek the harneys);
(Of pure gold was the quiver and also the fittings);
And riden forth a paas with sorweful cheere
And they rode forth slowly with sorrowful demeanor
Toward the grove, as ye shul after heere.
Toward the grove, as you shall later hear.
The nobleste of the Grekes that ther were
The noblest of the Greeks that were there
Upon hir shuldres caryeden the beere,
Carried the bier upon their shoulders,
With slakke paas and eyen rede and wete,
With slow pace and eyes red and wet,
Thurghout the citee by the maister strete,
Throughout the city by the main street,
That sprad was al with blak, and wonder hye
Which was all spread with black, and wonderfully high
Right of the same is the strete ywrye.
The street is covered with exactly the same.

With vessels in hir hand of gold ful fyn,
With vessels of pure gold in their hands,
Al ful of hony, milk, and blood, and wyn;
All full of honey, milk, and blood, and wine;
Eek Palamon, with ful greet compaignye;
Also Palamon, with a very large company;
And after that cam woful Emelye,
And after that came woeful Emelye,
With fyr in honde, as was that tyme the gyse,
With fire in hand, as was at that time the custom,
To do the ritual of funeral service.
To do the office of funeral service.
Heigh labour and ful greet apparaillynge
Much labor and full great preparation
Was at the service and the fyr-makynge,
Was at the service and the fire-making,
That with his grene top the hevene raughte;
Which with its green top reached the heaven;
And twenty fadme of brede the armes straughte --
And twenty fathom of breadth the sides stretched --
This is to seyn, the bowes weren so brode.
This is to say, the boughs were so broad.
Of stree first ther was leyd ful many a lode.
There was first laid very many a load of straw.
But how the fyr was maked upon highte,

That was nat wont to seen the sonne bright;
Which was not accustomed to see the bright sun;
Ne how the fyr was couched first with stree,
Nor how the fire was laid first with straw,
And thanne with drye stikkes cloven a thre,
And then with dry branches cut in thirds,
And thanne with grene wode and spicerye,
And then with green wood and mixtures of spices,
And thanne with clooth of gold and with perrye,
And then with cloth of gold and with precious stones
And gerlandes, hangynge with ful many a flour;
And garlands, hanging with full many a flower;

The myrrh, the incense, with such great fragrance;

Al stynted is the moornynge and the teres
All stopped is the mourning and the tears
Of Grekes, by oon general assent.
Of the Greeks, by one general assent.
Thanne semed me ther was a parlement
Then it seemed to me there was a parliament
At Atthenes, upon certein pointz and caas;
At Athens, upon certain topics and cases;

Among which topics was discussed (a proposal)
To have with certein contrees alliaunce,
To have alliance with certain countries,
And have fully of Thebans obeisaunce.
And have fully the submission of the Thebans.
For which this noble Theseus anon
For which this noble Theseus immediately
Leet senden after gentil Palamon,
Ordered (someone) to send for gentle Palamon,
Unwist of hym what was the cause and why,
Unknown by him (Palamon) what was the cause and why,
But in his blake clothes sorwefully
But in his black clothes sorrowfully
He cam at his comandement in hye.
He came at his (Theseus's) commandment in haste.
Tho sente Theseus for Emelye.
Then Theseus sent for Emelye.
Whan they were set, and hust was al the place,
When they were set, and all the place was hushed,
And Theseus abiden hadde a space
And Theseus had waited for a while
Er any word cam fram his wise brest,
Before any word came from his wise breast,
His eyen sette he ther as was his lest.
He set his eyes where his object of desire was.
And with a sad visage he siked stille,
And with a sad face he sighed softly,
And after that right thus he seyde his wille:
And after that exactly thus he pronounced his decision:
"The Firste Moevere of the cause above,
"The First Mover of the First Cause above,
Whan he first made the faire cheyne of love,
When he first made the faire chain of love,
Greet was th'effect, and heigh was his entente.
Great was the effect, and noble was his plan.
Wel wiste he why, and what thereof he mente,
Well knew he why, and what thereof he meant,
For with that faire cheyne of love he bond
For with that faire chain of love he bound
The fyr, the eyr, the water, and the lond
The fire, the air, the water, and the land
In certeyn boundes, that they may nat flee.
In definite bounds, from which they may not flee.
That same Prince and that Moevere," quod he,
That same Prince and that Mover," said he,
"Hath stablissed in this wrecched world adoun

Certeyne dayes and duracioun
Specific (numbers of) days and (term of) duration
To al that is engendred in this place,
To all that is engendered in this place,
Over the whiche day they may nat pace,
Beyond the which day they can not pass,
Al mowe they yet tho dayes wel abregge.
Although they may yet well shorten those days.
Ther nedeth noght noon auctoritee t'allegge,
There is no need to cite any written authority,
For it is preeved by experience,
For it is proven by experience,
But that me list declaren my sentence.
Unless I wish to make my meaning more clear.
Thanne may men by this ordre wel discerne
Then one can by this order well discern
That thilke Moevere stable is and eterne.
That that same Mover is stable and eternal.
Wel may men knowe, but it be a fool,
Well may one know, unless it be a fool,
That every part dirryveth from his hool,
That every part derives from its whole,
For nature hath nat taken his bigynnyng
For nature has not taken its beginning
Of no partie or cantel of a thyng,
Of no part or portion of a thing,
But of a thyng that parfit is and stable,
But of a thing that is complete and stable,
Descendynge so til it be corrumpable.
Descending (from that) until it becomes corruptible.
And therfore, of his wise purveiaunce,
And therefore, by his wise foresight,
He hath so wel biset his ordinaunce
He has so well established his plan
That speces of thynges and progressiouns
That types of being and natural processes

Shall endure (for a set time) one after another,
And nat eterne, withouten any lye.
And not eternally, without any lie.
This maystow understonde and seen at ye.
This thou canst understand and plainly see.
"Loo the ook, that hath so long a norisshynge
"Lo the oak, that is so slow to mature,
From tyme that it first bigynneth to sprynge,
From the time that it first begins to spring,
And hath so long a lif, as we may see,
And has so long a life, as we may see,
Yet at the laste wasted is the tree.
Yet at the last the tree is wasted away.
"Considereth eek how that the harde stoon
"Consider also how the hard stone
Under oure feet, on which we trede and goon,
Under our feet, on which we tread and go,
Yet wasteth it as it lyth by the weye.
Eventually it is worn away as it lies by the way.
The brode ryver somtyme wexeth dreye;
The broad river sometimes grows dry;
The grete tounes se we wane and wende.
We see the great cities grow weak and pass away.
Thanne may ye se that al this thyng hath ende.
Then you can see that all things have an end.
"Of man and womman seen we wel also

Som in the large feeld, as men may see;
One in the large field, as people can see;
Ther helpeth noght; al goth that ilke weye.
Nothing helps there; all goes that same way.
Thanne may I seyn that al this thyng moot deye.
Then may I say that all things must die.
"What maketh this but Juppiter, the kyng,
"What causes this but Jupiter, the king,

Who is prince and cause of all things,
Convertynge al unto his propre welle
Causing all to return to its own origin
From which it is dirryved, sooth to telle?
From which it is derived, to tell the truth?
And heer-agayns no creature on lyve,
And against this no living creature,
Of no degree, availleth for to stryve.
Of any rank, is helped by striving.
"Thanne is it wysdom, as it thynketh me,
"Then is it wisdom, as it seems to me,
To maken vertu of necessitee,
To make virtue of necessity,
And take it weel that we may nat eschue,
And take it well what we may not escape,
And namely that to us alle is due.
And namely that which is due to us all.
And whoso gruccheth ought, he dooth folye,
And whoever complains in any way, he does folly,
And rebel is to hym that al may gye.
And is rebel to Him that can rule all.
And certeinly a man hath moost honour
And certainly a man has most honor
To dyen in his excellence and flour,
To die in his (time of) excellence and flower,
Whan he is siker of his goode name;
When he is sure of his good name;
Thanne hath he doon his freend, ne hym, no shame.
Then he has not done his friend, nor himself, any shame.
And gladder oghte his freend been of his deeth,
And his friend ought to be more pleased with his death,
Whan with honour up yolden is his breeth,
When his breath is yielded up with honor,
Than whan his name apalled is for age,
Than when his name is faded because of age,
For al forgeten is his vassellage.
For all forgotten is his knightly prowess.
Thanne is it best, as for a worthy fame,
Then is it best, for a worthy fame,
To dyen whan that he is best of name.
To die when he has the most fame.
"The contrarie of al this is wilfulnesse.
"The contrary of all this is willfulness.
Why grucchen we, why have we hevynesse,
Why do we complain, why do we have sadness,
That goode Arcite, of chivalrie flour,
That good Arcite, flower of chivalry,
Departed is with duetee and honour
Is departed with all due honor
Out of this foule prisoun of this lyf?
Out of this foul prison of this life?
Why grucchen heere his cosyn and his wyf
Why do his cousin and his wife complain here
Of his welfare, that loved hem so weel?
Of the welfare of him, who loved them so well?
Kan he hem thank? Nay, God woot, never a deel,
Can he show them his gratitude? Nay, God knows, not a bit;

They offend both his soul and themselves as well,

And as yet they may not change their desires.

"What can I conclude of this long argument,
But after wo I rede us to be merye
But after woe I advise us to be merry
And thanken Juppiter of al his grace?

For gentil mercy oghte to passen right."
For gentle mercy ought to prevail over justice."
Thanne seyde he thus to Palamon the knight:
Then said he thus to Palamon the knight:
"I trowe ther nedeth litel sermonyng
"I suppose little preaching is needed here
To make yow assente to this thyng.
To make you assent to this thing.
Com neer, and taak youre lady by the hond."
Come near, and take your lady by the hand."

Palamon has wedded Emelye.
And God, that al this wyde world hath wroght,
And God, who has made all this wide world,
Sende hym his love that hath it deere aboght;
Send him his love who has dearly paid for it;
For now is Palamon in alle wele,
For now is Palamon in complete happiness,
Lyvynge in blisse, in richesse, and in heele,
Living in bliss, in riches, and in health,
And Emelye hym loveth so tendrely,
And Emelye loves him so tenderly,
And he hire serveth so gentilly,
And he serves her so gently,
That nevere was ther no word hem bitwene
That never was there any word between them
Of jalousie or any oother teene.
Of jealousy or any other vexation.
Thus endeth Palamon and Emelye;
Thus ends Palamon and Emelye;
And God save al this faire compaignye! Amen.
And God save all this fair company! Amen.
