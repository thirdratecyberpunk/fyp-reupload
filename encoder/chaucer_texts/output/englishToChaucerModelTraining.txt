And in the pan's bottom he has left it;	And in the pannes botme he hath it laft;

Exactly as he wished, he made the priest his ape!	Right as hym liste, the preest he made his ape!
And in his working to stoop low,	And in his werkyng for to stoupe lowe,
And cast in powder, and made the priest to blow,	And caste in poudre, and made the preest to blowe,
And on the fire quickly he has set it,	And on the fir as swithe he hath it set,
He put this ounce of copper in the crucible,	He putte this ounce of coper in the crosselet,
And for no other cause, truly.	And for noon oother cause, trewely.
With the intention that men may be warned by this,	To th'entente that men may be war therby,
And nonetheless I will yet express it,	And nathelees yet wol I it expresse,
It wearies me to tell of his falseness,	It weerieth me to telle of his falsnesse,
But he was fiendish both in deed and thought.	But he was feendly bothe in werk and thoght.

As servant of my wit, the duplicity	As ministre of my wit, the doublenesse
All too simple is my tongue to pronounce,	Al to symple is my tonge to pronounce,
And of that copper weighed out only an ounce.	And of that coper weyed out but an ounce.
And this canon took it in his hands,	And this chanon it in his handes nam,

Now, good sir, go forth thy way and hurry thee."	Now, goode sire, go forth thy wey and hy the."

Body and possessions. "Yes," quickly said the canon,	Body and good. "Ye," quod the chanoun soone,
And to the canon he offered again	And to the chanoun he profred eftsoone
In any manner his mirth and his gladness;	In no manere his myrthe and his gladnesse;

Supposing nothing but truth, sooth to say,	Supposynge noght but treuthe, sooth to seyn,
When this priest was thus beguiled again,	Whan that this preest thus was bigiled ageyn,
Now, good sirs, what more will you have?	Now, good sires, what wol ye bet than wel?

Of silver filings was put, as before	Of silver lemaille put was, as bifore
In the end of which an ounce, and no more,	In the ende of which an ounce, and namoore,
A hollow stick -- pay attention and beware! --	An holwe stikke -- taak kep and be war! --
And for show in his hand he bore	And for a contenaunce in his hand he bar
Was all ready to beguile this priest again,	Al redy was this preest eft to bigile,
In order to come to the realization of his desire.	For to come to th' effect of his desir.
Commanded him, and blew hard on the fire,	Comanded hym, and faste blew the fir,
To do as this canon, this cursed man,	To doon as this chanoun, this cursed man,
This priest busies himself in all that he knows how	This preest hym bisieth in al that he kan

But, if you condescend to teach me	But, and ye vouche-sauf to techen me

"See what is there; put in thy hand and grope.	"Loke what ther is; put in thyn hand and grope.
When it pleased him, and commanded the priest quickly,	Whan that hym luste, and bad the preest as faste,
And in the pan of water he cast it,	And in the water-vessel he it caste,
And put it in the ingot with merry demeanor,	And in th'yngot putte it with myrie cheere,
And in his sleeve again he did hide it,	And in his sleve agayn he gan it hide,
So slyly that the priest did not see it,	So slyly that the preest it nat espide,
Of this small bar, without any doubt,	Of this teyne, withouten any drede,

And pay attention now to his cursed trick!	And taaketh heede now of his cursed sleighte!
Which was not more than an ounce of weight.	Which that ne was nat but an ounce of weighte.
A small bar of silver -- may he have evil luck! --	A teyne of silver -- yvele moot he cheeve! --

Of an ingot, as I shall tell you.	Of an ingot, as I shal yow devyse.
Why should I tarry all the long day?	What sholde I tarien al the longe day?
And came back again without any delay.	And coome agayn withouten any delay.

An ounce of this quicksilver, and here begin,	Of this quyksilver an ounce, and heer bigynne,
Take in thy hand, and thyself put therein	Taak in thyn hand, and put thyself therinne
"This instrument," said he, "which thou seest,	"This instrument," quod he, "which that thou seest,
From his bosom, and showed it to the priest.	Of his bosom, and shewed it to the preest.
And this canon took out a crucible	And this chanoun took out a crosselet
The coals right away were fetched,	The coles right anon weren yfet,
So that he might go to his working right away.	That he anon myghte go to his werkynge.
And bad the servant to bring coals,	And bad the servant coles for to brynge,
And he laid them down neatly and carefully,	And he hem leyde faire and wel adoun,
With this quicksilver, shortly to say,	With this quyksilver, shortly for to sayn,
And went forth, and came right back again	And wente hym forth, and cam anon agayn
And he was all ready at his bidding,	And he al redy was at his biddyng,
He bad his servant fetch him this thing,	He bad his servant fecchen hym this thyng,
"Sir," said the priest, "it shall be done, indeed."	"Sire," quod the preest, "it shal be doon, ywis."
A wonderful thing, which you never saw before this."	A wonder thyng, which ye saugh nevere er this."
And when he comes, quickly you shall see	And whan he comth, as faste shal ye see
And have him bring two or three ounces;	And lat hym bryngen ounces two or three;
For quicksilver, would that we had it right now;	For quyksilver, that we it hadde anon;
Now pay attention to this canon's cursedness!	Now taak heede of this chanons cursednesse!
That have consumed and wasted my redness.	Consumed and wasted han my reednesse.
Of metals, which you have heard me rehearse,	Of metals, whiche ye han herd me reherce,
In my visage; for various fumes	In my visage; for fumes diverse
For redness have I none, very well I know,	For reednesse have I noon, right wel I knowe,
At least they begin to glow,	Algates they bigynnen for to glowe,
For shame of him my cheeks grow red.	For shame of hym my chekes wexen rede.
Every time I speak of his falsehood,	Evere whan that I speke of his falshede,
It distresses me to compose rimes about his falseness.	Of his falsnesse it dulleth me to ryme.
Who knows a hundred times more trickery.	That kan an hundred foold moore subtiltee.
It was another canon, and not he,	It was another chanoun, and nat hee,
Sir host, in faith, and by the heaven's queen,	Sire hoost, in feith, and by the hevenes queene,
This canon was my lord, you would suppose?	This chanon was my lord, ye wolden weene?
Insofar as my skill will stretch.	As ferforth as that my konnyng wol strecche.
And also the falseness of that other wretch,	And eek the falsnesse of that oother wrecche,
To tell thy lack of prudence and thy folly,	To tellen thyn unwit and thy folye,
Unhappy man, right now I will hasten myself	Unhappy man, anon I wol me hye
That refers to thy ruin,	That refereth to thy confusion,
His cunning deceptions thou canst not flee.	His wily wrenches thou ne mayst nat flee.
Which this fox has destined for thee!	Which that this fox yshapen hath to thee!
In no way art thou aware of the deceit	No thyng ne artow war of the deceite
O unfortunate, completely blind is thy mind,	O gracelees, ful blynd is thy conceite,
Very soon thou shalt be blinded by greed!	With coveitise anon thou shalt be blent!
O hapless priest! O hapless innocent!	O sely preest! O sely innocent!
And of his coming harm he felt nothing.	Ne of his harm comynge he no thyng felte.
This priest knew not with whom he dealt,	Noght wiste this preest with whom that he delte,
God keep us from his false dissimulation!	God kepe us from his false dissymulynge!
Such fiendish thoughts in his heart are fixed --	Swiche feendly thoghtes in his herte impresse --
Who evermore has delight and gladness --	That everemoore delit hath and gladnesse --
In (the deeds of) this canon, root of all treachery,	In this chanoun, roote of al trecherie,
And very soon I will verify it	And that ful soone I wol it verifie
Stinks, as these old wise writers bear witness,	Stynketh, as witnessen thise olde wyse,
Very true it is that such a favor not asked for	Ful sooth it is that swich profred servyse
Lo, how this thief could offer his service!	Loo, how this theef koude his service beede!
Said the canon, "and otherwise God forbid!"	Quod the chanoun, "and ellis God forbeede!"
"At your commandment, sir, truly,"	"At youre comandement, sire, trewely,"
"Yes," said the priest, "yes, sir, and will you so?	"Ye," quod the preest, "ye, sire, and wol ye so?
That I will do a masterful work before I go."	That I wol doon a maistrie er I go."

Something with which to repay your kindness	Somwhat to quyte with youre kyndenesse
And shown to me such great courtesy,	And kithed to me so greet gentillesse,
Since you have been so goodly unto me,	Syn ye so goodlich han been unto me,
Nor did I ever intend falsehood in my heart.	Ne nevere falshede in myn herte I mente.
For gold or silver that he lent to me,	For gold ne silver that he to me lente,
That there was never man yet suffered evil	That ther was nevere man yet yvele apayd
I thank God, and rightly it may be said,	God thanke I, and in good tyme be it sayd,
Believe this is as true as your Creed.	Bileveth this as siker as your Crede.
Into my grave, and God forbid it be otherwise.	Into my grave, and ellis God forbede.
Until that day in which I shall creep	Unto that day in which that I shal crepe
My pledged word is a thing that I will always keep	Trouthe is a thyng that I wol evere kepe
Nay, that would be a thing completely without precedent.	Nay, that were thyng yfallen al of newe.
To such a man I can never say no."	To swich a man I kan never seye nay."
That in no way will he fail to pay on his assigned day:	That in no wise he breke wole his day;

"Certainly," said he, "in no way does it annoy me	"Certes," quod he, "no thyng anoyeth me
For which this priest was wonderfully glad and happy.	Wherof this preest was wonder glad and fayn.
And to the priest he gave back his gold,	And to the preest he took his gold agayn,
And at the third day brought his money,	And at the thridde day broghte his moneye,
And this canon thanked him many times,	And this chanoun hym thanked ofte sithe,
This priest gave him a mark, and that very quickly,	This preest hym took a marc, and that as swithe,
The next day have me hanged by the neck!"	Another day do hange me by the hals!"
And if it so be that thou find me false,	And if so be that thow me fynde fals,
And at my assigned day I will repay it to thee.	And at my day I wol it quiten thee.
"Loan me a mark," said he, "for only three days,	"Leene me a marc," quod he, "but dayes three,
Of gold, and he would pay it back to him again.	Of gold, and he wolde quite it hym ageyn.
Beseeching him to lend him a certain amount	Bisechynge hym to lene hym a certeyn
Unto this priest's chamber, where he stayed,	Unto this preestes chambre, wher he lay,
Who brought this priest to ruin.	That broghte this preest to confusioun.
And tell forth my tale of the canon	That does not not matter; I will now proceed,
Therof no fors; I wol procede as now,	And he had plenty of spending money.
And spendyng silver hadde he right ynow.	For board nor clothing, went he never so gay,
For bord ne clothyng, wente he never so gaye,	That she would not allow him to pay anything
That she wolde suffre hym no thyng for to paye	Unto the woman, where he took his meals,
Unto the wyf, where as he was at table,	Who was so pleasant and so attentive
Which was so plesaunt and so servysable	Who therein had dwelled many a year,
That therinne dwelled hadde many a yeer,	In London was a priest, a chantry priest,
But in this cas herkneth what I shal seye.	And be not at all displeased, I pray you,
And beeth no thyng displesed, I yow preye,	If the prospect of shame or dishonor can cause any fear.
If shame or los may causen any drede.	Remove him quickly, I advise you,
Remoeveth hym bitymes, I yow rede,	If any Judas be in your convent,
If any Judas in youre covent be,	Save only this, if you will listen to me:
Save oonly this, if ye wol herkne me:	Who were guiltless? Concerning you I say the same,
That giltlees were? By yow I seye the same,	Then why should all the remnant have the blame
Thanne why sholde al the remenant have a blame	There was no traitor but Judas himself.
Ther nas no traytour but Judas hymselve.	That among Christ's twelve apostles
But eek for othere mo; ye woot wel how	This tale was not only told for you,
This tale was nat oonly toold for yow,	But I mean to correct what is amiss.
But to correcten that is mys I mente.	To slander you is not at all my intention,
To sclaundre yow is no thyng myn entente,	Should suffer for one single man's folly.
Sholde rewe o singuleer mannes folye.	And God forbid that a whole company
And God forbede that al a compaignye	There is some scoundrel in every order, by God,
Of every ordre som shrewe is, pardee,	Although my tale be about a canon.
Although that my tale of a chanoun bee.	Do not think that I slander your house,
Ne demeth nat that I sclaundre youre hous,	But worshipful religious canons,
I wol it tellen heere in youre presence.	And if you want to listen to me,
And if yow list to yeve me audience,	Not knowing of his false way of life.
Noght knowynge of his false governaunce.	To seek him and have his acquaintance,
Hym for to seke and have his aqueyntaunce,	And yet men ride and walk very many a mile
And yet men ride and goon ful many a mile	And will, if he may live a while longer;
And wole, if that he lyve may a while;	Very many a man has he beguiled before this,
Ful many a man hath he bigiled er this,	Unless it be a fiend, as he himself is.
But it a feend be, as hymselven is.	That he will make a fool of him right away,
That he wol make hym doten anonright,	When he shall converse with any person,
And speke his wordes in so sly a kynde,	For in his technical terms he will so wrap himself,
For in his termes he wol hym so wynde,	In all this world is not his equal in falsehood,
In al this world of falshede nis his peer,	Though he might live a thousand years.
Though that he myghte lyve a thousand yeer.	No man could write, as I guess,
Ther koude no man writen, as I gesse,	His tricks and his infinite falseness
His sleightes and his infinite falsnesse	Rome, Alexandria, Troy, and any three others.
Rome, Alisaundre, Troye, and othere three.	Though it were as big as was Nineveh,
Thogh it as greet were as was Nynyvee,	Amongst us, who would infect a whole town,
Amonges us, wolde infecte al a toun,	There is a canon regular
By the time that I have made an end of my tale.	By that I of my tale have maad an ende.
That shall you know, before I from you wend,	That shul ye knowe, er that I fro yow wende,
And he that seems truest is a thief.	And he that semeth trewest is a theef.
Is the greatest fool, when it comes to the proof;	Is moost fool, whan it cometh to the preef;
He who seems the wisest, by Jesus,	He that semeth the wiseste, by Jhesus,
Right so, lo, it fares among us:	Right so, lo, fareth it amonges us:
Is not good, whatever men may chatter or cry.	Ne is nat good, what so men clappe or crye.
Nor every apple that is fair to the eye	Ne every appul that is fair at eye
Is not gold, as I have heard said;	Nis nat gold, as that I have herd told;
Every man seems a Solomon.	Every man semeth a Salomon.
And when we are all together every one,	And whan we been togidres everichoon,
And in our madness always we rave.	And in oure madnesse everemoore we rave.
We fail to get that which we want to have,	We faille of that which that we wolden have,
That we conclude always with something gone wrong.	That we concluden everemoore amys.
But, be it hot or cold, I dare say this,	But, be it hoot or coold, I dar seye this,
Another said the fire was too hot --	Another seyde the fir was over-hoot --
There was something wrong, I well know."	Ther was defaute in somwhat, wel I woot."
And unless I do, sirs, let me have the blame.	And but I do, sires, lat me han the wite.

Sometimes his goods are drowned in the sea,	Somtyme his good is drowned in the see,
Trust me well, in his prosperity.	Trusteth me wel, in his prosperitee.
A merchant, by God, may not endure forever,	A marchant, pardee, may nat ay endure,
We must put our possessions at risk.	Us moste putte oure good in aventure.
Another time it may go well indeed.	Another tyme it may be well ynow.
And though this thing may have turned out badly this time,	And though this thyng myshapped have as now,
Yet is there here, though we have not all.	Yet is ther heere, though that we han nat al.
And sifted, and picked over many a time.	And sifted, and ypiked many a throwe.
And all this rubbish thrown in a sieve	And al this mullok in a syve ythrowe,
And on the floor was cast a canvas,	And on the floor ycast a canevas,
The rubbish was swept in a heap,	The mullok on an heep ysweped was,
Pluck up your hearts and be glad and blithe."	Plukke up youre hertes and beeth glad and blithe."
As our practice is, have the floor quickly swept,	As usage is, lat swepe the floor as swithe,
Be as be may, be you in no way amazed;	Be as be may, be ye no thyng amased;
I am very sure that the pot was cracked.	I am right siker that the pot was crased.
Of these perils I will be wary next time.	Of thise perils I wol be war eftsoone.
But well I know great strife is among us.	But wel I woot greet strif is us among.
I can not tell what it was due to,	I kan nat telle wheron it was long,
That is the cause and none other, as I may prosper!"	That is the cause and oother noon, so thee'ch!"
Because our fire was not made of beech,	By cause oure fir ne was nat maad of beech,
"Nay," said the fourth, "be quiet and listen to me.	"Nay," quod the fourthe, "stynt and herkne me.

When our pot is broken, as I have said,	Whan that oure pot is broke, as I have sayd,
There is no greater woe, nor greater rancor nor ire.	Nis ther moore wo, ne moore rancour ne ire.
In hell, where he is lord and sire,	In helle, where that he is lord and sire,
I believe he is with us, that same scoundrel!	I trowe he with us be, that ilke shrewe!
Though the fiend does not show himself to our sight,	Though that the feend noght in oure sighte hym shewe,
Some leap into the roof. Without doubt,	Somme lepe into the roof. Withouten doute,
And some are scattered all over the floor;	And somme are scatered al the floor aboute;
Thus have we quickly lost many a pound --	Thus han we lost by tymes many a pound --
They pierce so, and through the wall they go.	They percen so, and thurgh the wal they goon.
Unless they were made of lime and stone;	But if they weren wroght of lym and stoon;
The sides of our vessels can not make resistance to them,	Oure walles mowe nat make hem resistence,
These metals are of such great violence	Thise metals been of so greet violence
The pot shatters, and farewell, all is gone!	The pot tobreketh, and farewel, al is go!

With a specific quantity of metals,	Of metals with a certeyn quantitee,
Before the pot on the fire is done,	Er that the pot be on the fir ydo,
Pass over this; I go unto my tale.	Passe over this; I go my tale unto.
Lo, thus these folk betray innocence!	Lo, thus this folk bitrayen innocence!
Men would slay them because of their knowledge.	Men wolde hem slee by cause of hir science.
And say that if they were recognized,	And seyn that if that they espied were,

If men so desire, this folk they can know.	If that men liste, this folk they knowe may.
Lo, thus by smelling and threadbare array,	Lo, thus by smellyng and threedbare array,
The odor will infect him, trust me.	The savour wole infecte hym, trusteth me.

So it seems -- for had they nothing but a sheet	So semeth it -- for nadde they but a sheete
For unto them it is a bitter sweet --	For unto hem it is a bitter sweete --
Yet of that art they can not be satisfied,	Yet of that art they kan nat wexen sadde,
In trust on that, from all that ever they had.	In trust therof, from al that evere they hadde.
That future tense has made men to be separated,	That futur temps hath maad men to dissevere,
I warn you well, it is to keep seeking forever.	I warne yow wel, it is to seken evere.
Such supposing and hope is sharp and hard;	Swich supposyng and hope is sharp and hard;
Supposing ever, though we sorely suffer,	Supposynge evere, though we sore smerte,
Except that good hope creeps into our heart,	But that good hope crepeth in oure herte,
For sorrow of which we almost go mad,	For sorwe of which almoost we wexen wood,

Of all these names now I will rest myself,	Of alle thise names now wol I me reste,

Because I am an unlearned man,	By cause that I am a lewed man,
Though I can not list them in their proper order,	Though I by ordre hem nat reherce kan,
That pertains unto our craft.	That is unto oure craft apertenyng.
There is also very many another thing	Ther is also ful many another thyng
Which we spent upon it, is lost also.	Is lost also, which we upon it laye.

And how all is put in an earthen pot,	And in an erthen pot how put is al,
That are ground into very fine powder;	That into poudre grounden been ful smal;
Of orpiment (arsenic trisulfide), burned bones, iron flakes,	Of orpyment, brent bones, iren squames,
And busy myself to tell you the names	And bisye me to telle yow the names
Of silver, or some other quantity --	Of silver, or som oother quantitee --
As on five or six ounces, it may well be,	As on fyve or sixe ounces, may wel be,
Of the things that we work upon --	Of thynges whiche that we werche upon --
Why should I tell each proportion	What sholde I tellen ech proporcion
I blow the fire until my heart faints.	I blowe the fir til that myn herte feynte.
Our mysterious craft, we seem wonderfully wise,	Oure elvysshe craft, we semen wonder wise,
When we are where we shall exercise	Whan we been there as we shul exercise
No matter about that; I will speak of our work.	Of that no charge; I wol speke of oure werk.
Thus was I once taught by a clerk.	Thus was I ones lerned of a clerk.
To have their fellows in pain and hardship.	To have hir felawes in peyne and disese.
For unto scoundrels it is joy and ease	For unto shrewes joye it is and ese
To lose their possessions as he himself has done.	To lesen hir good as he hymself hath do.
Then he incites other folk to that,	Thanne he exciteth oother folk therto,
Has lost his own possessions in this dangerous business,	Hath lost his owene good thurgh jupartye,
But empty his purse and make his wits thin.	But empte his purs and make his wittes thynne.
For so help me God, he shall not profit thereby,	For so helpe me God, therby shal he nat wynne,
If he continue, I consider his prosperity done for.	If he continue, I holde his thrift ydo.
Whatever sort of man that applies himself to that,	What maner man that casteth hym therto,
Let every man be warned by me forever!	Lat every man be war by me for evere!
That while I live I shall never repay it.	That whil I lyve I shal it quite nevere.
For gold that I have borrowed, truly,	Of gold that I have borwed, trewely,
And yet by this I am so indebted	And yet I am endetted so therby
That I have no possessions, wherever I fare;	That I have no good, wher that evere I fare;
Lo, how profitable it is to transute metals!	Lo, which avantage is to multiplie!
And by my work yet my eye is bleared.	And of my swynk yet blered is myn ye.
Whoever uses it (that art), sorely shall he rue! --	Whoso it useth, soore shal he rewe! --
Now is it pale and of a leaden hue --	Now is it wan and of a leden hewe --
And whereas my color was both fresh and red,	And wher my colour was bothe fressh and reed,
Now may I wear a hose upon my head;	Now may I were an hose upon myn heed;
Of clothing and of other splendid furnishings,	Of clothyng and of oother good array,
Where I was accustomed to be right fresh and gay	Ther I was wont to be right fressh and gay
And, God knows, so have many more than I.	And, God woot, so hath many mo than I.
And as to his science I am never the nearer (to success).	And of his science am I never the neer.

Here begins the Canon's Yeoman's Tale.	Heere bigynneth the Chanouns Yeman his Tale.
Here ends the Prologue of the Canon's Yeoman's Tale.	Heere endeth the Prologe of the Chanouns Yemannes Tale .
Such things as what I know, I will declare.	Swich thyng as that I knowe, I wol declare.
Since my lord is gone, I will not spare;	Syn that my lord is goon, I wol nat spare;
But nonetheless you desire that I tell part.	But nathelees yow wol I tellen part.
To tell all that belongs to that art!	To tellen al that longeth to that art!
I could never leave it in any way.	I koude nevere leve it in no wise.
For all my sorrow, labor, and mischief,	For al my sorwe, labour, and meschief,
And yet, for all my pain and all my grief,	And yet, for al my smert and al my grief,
That feel I well, whatever any man says.	That feele I wel, what so any man seith.
For it is serious (not game) to me, by my faith;	For it is ernest to me, by my feith;
Before he dies, may he have sorrow and shame!	Er that he dye, sorwe have he and shame!
He who brought me first unto that game,	He that me broghte first unto that game,
For penny nor for pound, I promise you.	For peny ne for pound, I yow biheete.
For never hereafter will I meet with him	For nevere heerafter wol I with hym meete
Right now I will tell all that I know.	Al that I kan anon now wol I telle.
"Ah!" said the Yeoman, "here shall arise some amusement;	"A!" quod the Yeman, "heere shal arise game;
He fled away for true sorrow and shame.	He fledde awey for verray sorwe and shame.
But that his Yeoman would tell his secrets,	But his Yeman wolde telle his pryvetee,
And when this Canon saw it would not be,	And whan this Chanon saugh it wolde nat bee,
"In faith," said he, "I do (reckon him) but little any more."	"In feith," quod he, "namoore I do but lyte."
Reckon all his threatening not worth a fraction of a penny!"	Of al his thretyng rekke nat a myte!"
"Yes," said our Host, "tell on, whataever may happen.	"Ye," quod oure Hoost, "telle on, what so bityde.
And also revealest what thou shouldest hide."	And eek discoverest that thou sholdest hyde."
For if thou do, thou shalt dearly pay for it.	For if thou do, thou shalt it deere abye.
"Hold thou thy peace and speak no more words,	"Hoold thou thy pees and spek no wordes mo,
And thus he said unto his Yeoman then:	And thus he seyde unto his Yeman tho:
To his Yeoman, to hear all his speech.	To his Yeman, to herknen al his sawe.
That was the cause he did draw himself so near	That was the cause he gan so ny hym drawe
Believes every thing is spoken about him, indeed.	Demeth alle thyng be spoke of hym, ywis.
For Cato says that he who is guilty	For Catoun seith that he that gilty is
Of men's speech ever had this Canon.	Of mennes speche evere hadde this Chanoun.
Which this Yeoman spoke, for suspicion	Which this Yeman spak, for suspecioun
While this Yeoman was thus in his talking,	Whil this Yeman was thus in his talkyng,
It will make us beggars at the last."	It wole us maken beggers atte laste."
Overtake it, it slides away so fast.	It overtake, it slit awey so faste.
We can not, although we had sworn it,	We mowen nat, although we hadden it sworn,
But that knowledge is so far ahead of us,	But that science is so fer us biforn,
To do it, and after it we grope.	It for to doon, and after it we grope.
Yet is it false, but always we have good hope	Yet is it fals, but ay we han good hope
That of one pound we could make two.	That of a pound we koude make tweye.
And make them believe, at the very least,	And make hem wenen, at the leeste weye,
And borrow gold, be it a pound or two,	And borwe gold, be it a pound or two,
To many folk we do delusion,	To muchel folk we doon illusioun,
For ever we lack our desired conclusion.	For evere we lakken oure conclusioun.
And despite all that, we fail to achieve our desire,	And for al that we faille of oure desir,
We blunder ever and stare in the fire,	We blondren evere and pouren in the fir,
But to work hard and to learn to transmute metals.	But swynke soore and lerne multiplie.
I am not accustomed to peer in any mirror,	I am nat wont in no mirour to prie,
That it has changed my color, I believe.	That it hath chaunged my colour, I trowe.
I am so used to blow in the fire	I am so used in the fyr to blowe
Why art thou so discolored in thy face?"	Why artow so discoloured of thy face?"
"Now," said our Host, "yet let me talk to thee.	"Now," quod oure Hoost, "yit lat me talke to the.
So fare we, if I shall say the truth."	So faren we, if I shal seye the sothe."
Like those who dare not show their presence;	As they that dar nat shewen hir presence;
Hold their private fearful residence,	Holden hir pryvee fereful residence,
Where these robbers and these thieves by nature	Whereas thise robbours and thise theves by kynde
"Lurking in hiding places and in dead-end alleys,	"Lurkynge in hernes and in lanes blynde,
"In the outskirts of a town," said he,	"In the suburbes of a toun," quod he,
Where do you dwell, if it can be told?"	Where dwelle ye, if it to telle be?"
Tell how he does, I pray thee heartily,	Telle how he dooth, I pray thee hertely,
"Since thou knowest of the cunning of thy lord,	"Syn of the konnyng of thy lord thow woost,
"That does not matter, good Yeoman," said our Host;	"Ther-of no fors, good Yeman," quod oure Hoost;
God amend it! I can tell you no more."	God it amende! I kan sey yow namoore."
So does my lord, and that sorely grieves me;	So dooth my lord, and that me greveth soore;
Very often he happens to misuse it.	Ful oft hym happeth to mysusen it.
For when a man has too great a wit,	For whan a man hath over-greet a wit,
Therefore in that I hold him ignorant and foolish.	Wherfore in that I holde hym lewed and nyce.
Right, as clerks say; it is a vice.	Aright, as clerkes seyn; it is a vice.
He is too wise, in faith, as I believe.	He is to wys, in feith, as I bileeve.
And therefore keep it secret, I pray you.)	And therfore keepe it secree, I yow preye.)
(But I will not publicly acknowledge what I say,	(But I wol nat avowe that I seye,
So help me God, for he shall never prosper!	God help me so, for he shal nevere thee!
"Why?" said this Yeoman, "why do you ask me?	"Why?" quod this Yeman, "wherto axe ye me?
Tell me that, and of that I beseech thee."	Telle me that, and that I thee biseche."
If his deeds accord with thy speech?	If that his dede accorde with thy speche?
And has the power to buy better cloth,	And is of power bettre clooth to beye,
Why is thy lord so slovenly, I pray thee,	Why is thy lord so sluttissh, I the preye,
Because in fact, to him, as I may go (I swear),	As in effect, to hym, so moot I go,
His outer garment is not worth a fraction of a penny,	His overslope nys nat worth a myte,
That he cares so little for his own self-respect.	That of his worshipe rekketh he so lite.
Because of which men should reverence him,	By cause of which men sholde hym reverence,
Since thy lord is of such great prudence,	Syn that thy lord is of so heigh prudence,
This thing is wonderfully marvelous to me,	This thyng is wonder merveillous to me,
Unto our Host, he said, "Bless you!	Unto oure Hoost, he seyde, "Benedicitee!
And when this Yeoman had this tale told	And whan this Yeman hadde this tale ytold
And pave it all with silver and with gold."	And pave it al of silver and of gold."
Until we come to Canterbury town,	Til that we come to Caunterbury toun,
That all this ground on which we are riding,	That al this ground on which we been ridyng,
And yet somewhat I help in his work --	And somwhat helpe I yet to his wirkyng --
But all his craft you can not know from me,	But al his craft ye may nat wite at me,
"I say, my lord knows such esoteric science --	"I seye, my lord kan swich subtilitee --
Host, I will show you something of his craft.	Hoost, of his craft somwhat I wol yow shewe.
Said this Yeoman, "and in few words,	Seyde this Yeman, "and in wordes fewe,
"Nay, he is greater than a clerk, indeed,"	"Nay, he is gretter than a clerk, ywis,"
Is he a clerk, or not? Tell what he is."	Is he a clerk, or noon? Telle what he is."
I tell you indeed, he is a remarkable man."	I warne yow wel, he is a passyng man."
He is a man of great discretion;	He is a man of heigh discrecioun;
All that I have in my possession.	Al that I have in my possessioun.
For great riches, I dare wager on that	For muchel good, I dar leye in balaunce
You would not forgo his acquaintance	Ye wolde nat forgoon his aqueyntaunce
If you knew him, it would be to your advantage.	If ye hym knewe, it wolde be for youre prow.
Despite how modestly he rides amongst you,	As hoomly as he rit amonges yow,
To bring about, unless they learn it from him.	To brynge aboute, but they of hym it leere.
Which would be very hard for any one who is here	Which were ful hard for any that is heere
He knows how to work, and that in a variety of ways.	He koude werke, and that in sondry wise.
You would wonder how well and craftily	Ye wolde wondre how wel and craftily
If you knew him as well as do I,	And ye hym knewe as wel as do I,
More than enough; also, sir, trust me,	Nat but ynough; also, sire, trusteth me,
He knows about mirth and also about jollity	He kan of murthe and eek of jolitee
"Who, sir? My lord? Yes, yes, without lie,	"Who, sire? My lord? Ye, ye, withouten lye,
With which he may gladden this company?"	With which he glade may this compaignye?"
Can he in any way tell a merry tale or two,	Can he oght telle a myrie tale or tweye,
He is very cheerful also, I dare wager!	He is ful jocunde also, dar I leye!
Then said our Host, "for certainly it would seem	Thanne seyde oure Hoost, "for certein it wolde seme
"Friend, for thy telling him God give thee good luck,"	"Freend, for thy warnyng God yeve thee good chaunce,"
For his pleasure; he loves sociability."	For his desport; he loveth daliaunce."
Who is very eager to ride with you	Which that to ryden with yow is ful fayn
And told my lord here and my sovereign,	And warned heer my lord and my soverayn,
I saw you ride out of your hostelry,	I saugh yow ryde out of youre hostelrie,
And said, "Sirs, just now in the morning time	And seyde, "Sires, now in the morwe-tyde
His yeoman also was full of courtesy,	His yeman eek was ful of curteisye,
To ride in this merry company."	To riden in this myrie compaignye."
Fast have I spurred," said he, "for your sake,	Faste have I priked," quod he, "for youre sake,
"God save," said he, "this jolly company!	"God save," quod he, "this joly compaignye!
And when he was come to us, he began to cry out,	And whan that he was come, he gan to crye,
Full of the herbs plantain and pellitory.	Were ful of plantayne and of paritorie.
His forehead dripped like a still	His forheed dropped as a stillatorie
But what a joy it was to see him sweat!	But it was joye for to seen hym swete!
For sweat and to keep his head from heat.	For swoot and for to keep his heed from heete.
A burdock-leaf he had under his hood	A clote-leef he hadde under his hood
He had always spurred as if he were crazy.	He hadde ay priked lik as he were wood.
His hat hung at his back down by a strap,	His hat heeng at his bak doun by a laas,
I judged him to be some sort of canon.	I demed hym som chanoun for to be.
For which, when I had long thought about it,	For which, whan I hadde longe avysed me,
How his cloak was sewn to his hood,	How that his cloke was sowed to his hood,
What he was until I understood	What that he was til that I understood
And in my heart I began to wonder	And in myn herte wondren I bigan
All lightly clad for summer rode this worthy man,	Al light for somer rood this worthy man,
It seemed that he carried little gear.	It semed that he caried lite array.
A double bag on his crupper lay;	A male tweyfoold on his croper lay;
About the collar stood the foam very high;	Aboute the peytrel stood the foom ful hye;
So sweated that it could hardly move.	So swatte that unnethe myghte it gon.
The horse also that his yeoman rode upon	The hors eek that his yeman rood upon
It seemed as if he had spurred hard for three miles.	It semed as he had priked miles three.
So sweated that it was a wonder to see;	So swatte that it wonder was to see;
His riding horse, that was all dapple gray,	His hakeney, that was al pomely grys,
And underneath that he had a white surplice.	And undernethe he hadde a whyt surplys.
A man who was clothed in black clothes,	A man that clothed was in clothes blake,
At Boghtoun under Blee overtook us	At Boghtoun under Blee us gan atake
When the life of Saint Cecile was ended,	Whan ended was the lyf of Seinte Cecile,
But thing that will not be, let it be still."	But thyng that wol nat be, lat it be stille."
For my purposes, if you knew my will;	As to my purpos, wiste ye my wille;
This is a fine tale for this occasion,	This is a gentil tale for the nones,
My wife at home had heard this legend once!	My wyf at hoom had herd this legende ones!
I would rather than have a barrel of ale	Me were levere than a barel ale
Our Host said, and swore, "By God's bones,	Oure Hooste seyde, and swoor, "By Goddes bones,
When ended was the tale of this worthy Clerk,	This worthy Clerk, whan ended was his tale,
Behold, the merry words of the Host.	Bihoold the murye words of the Host
Be ever in behavior as light as a leaf on a linden tree,	Be ay of chiere as light as leef on lynde,
To get thee friends always work hard;	To gete thee freendes ay do thy travaille;
If thou be ugly, be lavish in thy expenditures;	If thou be foul, be fre of thy dispence;
Show thou thy visage and thy apparel;	Shewe thou thy visage and thyn apparaille;
If thou be fair, where folk are present,	If thou be fair, ther folk been in presence,
And thou shalt make him cower as does a quail.	And thou shalt make hym couche as doth a quaille.
In jealousy I advise also that thou bind him,	In jalousie I rede eek thou hym bynde,
Shall pierce his breast and also his neck-guard.	Shal perce his brest and eek his aventaille.
The arrows of thy spiteful eloquence	The arwes of thy crabbed eloquence
Fear them not; do them no reverence,	Ne dreed hem nat; doth hem no reverence,
Ever wag your tongues like a windmill, I you advise.	Ay clappeth as a mille, I yow consaille.
Be fierce as is a tiger yonder in India;	Beth egre as is a tygre yond in Ynde;
And slender wives, feeble in battle,	And sklendre wyves, fieble as in bataille,
Suffer not that men do offense to you.	Ne suffreth nat that men yow doon offense.
Since you are strong as is a great camel;	Syn ye be strong as is a greet camaille;
You arch-wives, stand ready for battle,	Ye archewyves, stondeth at defense,
Since it may work to the benefit of all.	For commune profit sith it may availle.
Imprint well this lesson in your mind,	Emprenteth wel this lessoun in youre mynde,
Be not fooled because of your innocence,	Beth nat bidaffed for youre innocence,
But ever answers in reply.	But evere answereth at the countretaille.
Follow Echo, who holds no silence,	Folweth Ekko, that holdeth no silence,
Lest Chichevache swallow you in her entrails!	Lest Chichevache yow swelwe in hire entraille!
As of patient and kind Griselda,	As of Grisildis pacient and kynde,
To write about you a story of such marvel	To write of yow a storie of swich mervaille
Nor let any clerk have cause or eagerness	Ne lat no clerk have cause or diligence
Let no humility nail down your tongue,	Lat noon humylitee youre tonge naille,
O noble wives, full of great prudence,	O noble wyves, ful of heigh prudence,
His wife's patience trusting to find	His wyves pacience in trust to fynde
No wedded man so bold be to test	No wedded man so hardy be t'assaille
For which I cry in the hearing of all	For which I crie in open audience
And both together buried in Italy;	And bothe atones buryed in Ytaille;

Hear my song that says in this manner:	Herkneth my song that seith in this manere:
And let us stint of serious matter.	And lat us stynte of ernestful matere.
Say you a song to make you happy, I believe;	Seyn yow a song to glade yow, I wene;

Whose life and all her sect may God maintain	Whos lyf and al hire secte God mayntene
For which here, for the love of the Wife of Bath --	For which heere, for the Wyves love of Bathe --
It would rather break in two than bend.	It wolde rather breste a-two than plye.
With brass, that though the coin be fair to look at,	With bras, that thogh the coyne be fair at ye,
The gold of them has now been so badly debased	The gold of hem hath now so badde alayes
For if they were put to such tests,	For if that they were put to swiche assayes,
In all the town Griseldas three or two;	In al a toun Grisildis thre or two;
It would be very difficult to find now-a-days	It were ful hard to fynde now-a-dayes
But one word, lords, hear before I go:	But o word, lordynges, herkneth er I go:

Lenvoy de Chaucer.	Hear my song that says in this manner:
Herkneth my song that seith in this manere:	And let us stint of serious matter.
And lat us stynte of ernestful matere.	Say you a song to make you happy, I believe;
Seyn yow a song to glade yow, I wene;	I will with lusty heart, fresh and vigorous,
I wol with lusty herte, fressh and grene,	In high mastery, and otherwise it would be a pity --
In heigh maistrie, and elles were it scathe --	Whose life and all her sect may God maintain
For which heere, for the Wyves love of Bathe --	It would rather break in two than bend.
It wolde rather breste a-two than plye.	With brass, that though the coin be fair to look at,
With bras, that thogh the coyne be fair at ye,	The gold of them has now been so badly debased
The gold of hem hath now so badde alayes	For if they were put to such tests,
For if that they were put to swiche assayes,	In all the town Griseldas three or two;
In al a toun Grisildis thre or two;	It would be very difficult to find now-a-days
It were ful hard to fynde now-a-dayes	But one word, lords, hear before I go:
But o word, lordynges, herkneth er I go:	Let us then live in virtuous forbearance.
Lat us thanne lyve in vertuous suffraunce.	And for our best is all his governance.
Er we were born, knew al oure freletee;	Not to know our will, for certainly he,
Nat for to knowe oure wyl, for certes he,	Full often to be beaten in various ways;
Ful ofte to be bete in sondry wise;	With sharp whips of adversity
With sharpe scourges of adversitee	And permits us, for our own good
And suffreth us, as for oure excercise,	He tests folk all the time, it is no doubt,
He preeveth folk al day, it is no drede,	As says Saint James, if you his epistle read;
As seith Seint Jame, if ye his pistel rede;	But he tests no man that he redeemed,
But he ne tempteth no man that he boghte,	For it is very reasonable that he test what he made.
For greet skile is he preeve that he wroghte.	Receive with a good will all that God sends us;
Unto a mortal man, wel moore us oghte	For since a woman was so patient
For sith a womman was so pacient	This story, which with high style he composes.
This storie, which with heigh stile he enditeth.	As was Griselda; therefore Petrarch writes
As was Grisilde; therfore Petrak writeth	Should be constant in adversity
Sholde be constant in adversitee	But so that every person, in his station in life,
But for that every wight, in his degree,	For it would be intolerable, though they would (want to),
For it were inportable, though they wolde,	Follow Griselda in humility,
Folwen Grisilde as in humylitee,	This story is said not so that wives should
This storie is seyd nat for that wyves sholde	And listen to what this author says concerning this (tale).
As it hath been in olde tymes yoore,	This world is not so strong, there is no denying,
This world is nat so strong, it is no nay,	Although he put not his wife in great tests.
Al putte he nat his wyf in greet assay.	And fortunate was also in marriage,
And fortunat was eek in mariage,	In rest and peace, after his father's day,
In reste and pees, after his fader day,	His son succeeds in his heritage
His sone succedeth in his heritage	Until the soul out of his body creeps.
Til that the soule out of his body crepeth.	His wife's father in his court he keeps,
His wyves fader in his court he kepeth,	Of all Italy; and then in peace and rest
Of al Ytaille; and thanne in pees and reste	Unto a lord, one of the worthiest
And richely his doghter maryed he	Live these two in peace and in quiet,
Lyven thise two in concord and in reste,	Full many a year in high prosperity
Ful many a yeer in heigh prosperitee	Than was the revel of their marriage.
Than was the revel of hire mariage.	This feast was, and greater of cost,
This feste was, and gretter of costage,	For more splendid in every man's sight
For moore solempne in every mannes syght	Until in the sky shone the stars' light.
Til on the welkne shoon the sterres lyght.	This day in mirth and revel to spend
This day in murthe and revel to dispende	For every man and woman does his might
For every man and womman dooth his myght	Thus has this pitiful day a blissful end,
And ther she was honured as hire oghte.	Upon her head, they into hall her brought,
Upon hire heed, they into halle hire broghte,	With a crown of many a rich stone
With a coroune of many a riche stoon	And in a cloth of gold that brightly shone,
And in a clooth of gold that brighte shoon,	And strip her out of her crude clothing,
And strepen hire out of hire rude array,	Have taken her and into chamber they go,
Han taken hire and into chambre gon,	These ladies, when they see their time,
Thise ladyes, whan that they hir tyme say,	Between them two, now they are met together.
Bitwixe hem two, now they been met yfeere.	That it was delightful to see the happiness
That it was deyntee for to seen the cheere	Walter strives so faithfully to please her
Til she hath caught agayn hire contenaunce.	And every person makes joy and festivity for her
And every wight hire joye and feeste maketh	She rises up, disconcerted, from her trance,
She riseth up, abaysed, from hire traunce,	Walter comforts her and her sorrow relieves;
Walter hire gladeth and hire sorwe slaketh;	Hardly about her might they remain.
Unnethe abouten hire myghte they abyde.	Down ran of them that stood beside her;
Doun ran of hem that stooden hire bisyde;	O many a tear on many a pitiful face
O many a teere on many a pitous face	The children from her arm they did tear away.
The children from hire arm they gonne arace.	That with great effort and great difficulty
That with greet sleighte and greet difficultee	Her children two, when she embraced them,
And in hire swough so sadly holdeth she	All suddenly she fell down to the ground.
Al sodeynly she swapte adoun to grounde.	Has had you protected" -- and in that same moment
Hath doon yow kept" -- and in that same stounde	And your benign father tenderly
And youre benyngne fader tendrely	Had eaten you; but God of his mercy
Hadde eten yow; but God of his mercy	That cruel hounds or some foul animal pests
That crueel houndes or som foul vermyne	Your woeful mother truly believed
Youre woful mooder wende stedfastly	"O tender, o dear, o my young children!
"O tendre, o deere, o yonge children myne!	Death does not matter, nor when my spirit may pass (away)!
No fors of deeth, ne whan my spirit pace!	Since I stand in your love and in your grace,
Now rekke I nevere to been deed right heere;	"That you have saved for me my children dear!
"That ye han saved me my children deere!	"Great thanks, lord, may God repay it to you," said she,
"Grauntmercy, lord, God thanke it yow," quod she,	Her swooning, and her humble voice to hear!
Hir swownyng, and hire humble voys to heere!	O what a pathetic thing it was to see
O which a pitous thyng it was to se	She bathed both their visage and their hair.
She bathed bothe hire visage and hire heeres.	Full like a mother, with her salt tears
Ful lyk a mooder, with hire salte teeres	Embraces them, and tenderly kissing
Embraceth hem, and tendrely kissynge	And in her arms, pitifully weeping,
And in hire armes, pitously wepynge,	She calls both her young children to her,
For pitous joye, and after hire swownynge	When she heard this, down she falls in a swoon
Whan she this herde, aswowne doun she falleth	Until I knew thy perseverence and all thy will."
Til I thy purpos knewe and al thy wille."	But to keep them secretly and quietly,
But for to kepe hem pryvely and stille,	And not to slay my children -- God forbid! --
And nat to sleen my children -- God forbeede! --	But to test in thee thy womanhood,
But for t'assaye in thee thy wommanheede,	For no malice, nor for no cruelty,
For no malice, ne for no crueltee,	I declare to them clearly that I have done this deed
I warne hem wel that I have doon this deede	"And folk that otherwise have said of me,
"And folk that ootherweys han seyd of me,	That thou hast lost any of thy children two.
Taak hem agayn, for now maystow nat seye	At Bologna I have kept them secretly;
At Boloigne have I kept hem prively;	Thou bore him in thy body truly.
Thou bare hym in thy body trewely.	Shall be my heir, as I have ever intended;
Shal be myn heir, as I have ay disposed;	To be my wife; that other truly
To be my wyf; that oother feithfully	"This is thy daughter, which thou hast supposed
"This is thy doghter, which thou hast supposed	Nor ever had, as God my soul may save!
Ne nevere hadde, as God my soule save!	Thou art my wife, and none other I have,
Thou art my wyf, ne noon oother I have,	"Griselda," said he, "by God, who for us died,
"Grisilde," quod he, "by God, that for us deyde,	Until out of her bewilderment she suddenly awoke.
She ferde as she had stert out of a sleep,	She heard not what thing he said to her;
She herde nat what thyng he to hire seyde;	And she for amazement took of it no notice;
And she for wonder took of it no keep;	And took her in arms and kissed her.
And hire in armes took and gan hire kesse.	Now I know, dear wife, thy steadfastness" --
Now knowe I, dere wyf, thy stedfastnesse" --	In great estate and in poverty.
In greet estaat and povreliche arrayed.	As well as ever woman was, tested,
As wel as evere womman was, assayed,	I have thy faith and thy goodness,
I have thy feith and thy benyngnytee,	"Be now no more frightened nor displeased.
"Be now namoore agast ne yvele apayed.	"This is enough, Griselda mine," said he;
To rewen upon hire wyfly stedfastnesse.	This stern marquis inclined his heart
This sturdy markys gan his herte dresse	Continuing ever her innocence in every way,
Continuynge evere hire innocence overal,	And she ever steadfast and constant as a wall,
And she ay sad and constant as a wal,	And he so often had done to her offence,
And he so ofte had doon to hire offence,	Her glad expression, and no malice at all,
Hir glade chiere, and no malice at al,	And when this Walter saw her patience,
And whan this Walter saugh hire pacience,	As could a poorly reared creature."
As koude a povre fostred creature."	She could not endure adversity
She koude nat adversitee endure	More tenderly, and, as I believe,
For she is fostred in hire norissynge	This tender maiden, as you have done to others;
This tendre mayden, as ye han doon mo;	That you not distress with any tormenting
That ye ne prikke with no tormentynge	"One thing I beseech you, and warn also,
"O thyng biseke I yow, and warne also,	Pleasure enough unto your lives' end.
Plesance ynogh unto youre lyves ende.	And so I hope that he will to you send
And so hope I that he wol to yow sende	I pray to God to give her prosperity;
I prey to God yeve hire prosperitee;	I never saw so fair a one as she.
A fairer saugh I nevere noon than she.	"Right well," said she, "my lord; for, in good faith,
"Right wel," quod she, "my lord; for, in good fey,	"How do you like my wife and her beauty?"
"Grisilde," quod he, as it were in his pley,	Griselda, as she was busy in his hall.
Grisilde, as she was bisy in his halle.	To sit down to dinner, he called
To sitten doun to mete, he gan to calle	But at the last, when these lords went
But atte laste, whan that thise lordes wende	So well that no man could praise her more highly.
So wel that no man koude hir pris amende.	With all her heart, in full benign intention,
With al hir herte, in ful benyngne entente,	This maid and also her brother to commend
This mayde and eek hir brother to commende	In all this mean while she did not cease
In al this meene while she ne stente	And deservedly they praise her prudence.
And worthily they preisen hire prudence.	And knew how to do such honor and reverence,
That in so povre array was for to see,	But ever they wonder who she might be
But ay they wondren what she myghte bee	That no man perceives any fault,
That no defaute no man aperceyveth,	And so skillfully, each according to his rank,
And so konnyngly, everich in his degree,	With such glad manner his guests she receives,
With so glad chiere his gestes she receyveth,	And after that carries on her work.
And after that dooth forth hire bisynesse.	With other folk to greet the marchioness,
With oother folk to greete the markysesse,	But with glad manner to the gate is went
But with glad cheere to the yate is went	Though it was crude and also somewhat ragged;
Thogh it were rude and somdeel eek torent;	Not at all was she ashamed of her clothing,
That to the feeste was apertinent.	Full busy was Griselda in every thing
Ful bisy was Grisilde in every thyng	And tell her constancy and her diligence.
And telle hir constance and hir bisynesse.	But to Griselda again will I address myself,
But to Grisilde agayn wol I me dresse,	No more of this make I now mention,
Namoore of this make I now mencioun,	To have a new lady of their town.
To han a newe lady of hir toun.	For they were glad, right for the novelty,
For they were glad, right for the noveltee,	When the people gazed up and down,
Whan that the peple gazed up and doun,	Thus said serious folk in that city,
Thus seyden sadde folk in that citee,	A full great fool is he that believes in you."
Youre doom is fals, youre constance yvele preeveth;	Always full of chattering, not worth a penny!
Ay ful of clappyng, deere ynogh a jane!	For like the moon ever you wax and wane!
For lyk the moone ay wexe ye and wane!	Delighting ever in rumor that is new,
Delitynge evere in rumbul that is newe,	Ever undiscerning and changing like a weather vane!
Ay undiscreet and chaungynge as a fane!	"O stormy people! Inconstant and ever untrue!
"O stormy peple! Unsad and evere untrewe!	Commending now the marquis's governance.
Commendynge now the markys governaunce.	That the people take pleasure in seeing them,
That hem to seen the peple hath caught plesaunce,	Her brother also so fair was of visage
Hir brother eek so fair was of visage	And more pleasing, because of her high lineage.
And fairer fruyt bitwene hem sholde falle,	Than is Griselda, and more tender of age,
Than is Grisilde, and moore tendre of age,	For she is fairer, as they all decide,
For she is fairer, as they deemen alle,	To change his wife, for it was for the best.
To chaunge his wyf, for it was for the beste.	That Walter was no fool, though he desired
That Walter was no fool, thogh that hym leste	And then for the first time amongst themselves they say
And thanne at erst amonges hem they seye	Of their accoutrements, so rich in appearance;
Of hire array, so richely biseye;	For which the people ran to see the sight
For which the peple ran to seen the sighte	Who with him brought these noble children two,
That with hym broghte thise noble children tweye,	About mid-morning did this earl alight,
Hath every chambre arrayed and his halle.	And she, the most willing to serve of all,
And she, the mooste servysable of alle,	To hasten themselves, and fast sweep and dust;
To hasten hem, and faste swepe and shake;	Praying the chambermaids, for God's sake,
Preyynge the chambereres, for Goddes sake,	And took pains to do all that she could,
And peyned hire to doon al that she myghte,	And to set tables, and make beds;
And tables for to sette, and beddes make;	And with that word she began to prepare the house,
And with that word she gan the hous to dighte,	To love you best with all my true will."
To love yow best with al my trewe entente."	Shall the spirit within my heart cease
Ne shal the goost withinne myn herte stente	Nor never, for any happiness nor any woe,
Withouten feyntyng, and shal everemo;	You to serve and please in accord with my rank
Yow for to serve and plese in my degree	"To do your wishes, but I desire also
"To doon youre lust, but I desire also	"Not only, lord, I am glad," said she,
"Nat oonly, lord, that I am glad," quod she,	Do thou thy duty at least."
Do thou thy devoir at the leeste weye."	Though thy dress be bad and in poor condition,
Thogh thyn array be badde and yvel biseye,	Thou knowest also of old all my desires;
Thou knowest eek of old al my plesaunce;	That thine be the supervision of all this business.
That thyn were al swich manere governaunce.	According to my wishes, and therefore I would like
After my lust, and therfore wolde I fayn	The chambers to put in order
"I have no wommen suffisaunt, certayn,	And great pleasure, as I can best arrange.
And heigh plesaunce, as I kan best devyse.	Have his due respect, in seating and service
Have his estaat, in sittyng and servyse	And also that every person, according to his rank
And eek that every wight in his degree	As it is possible in my house to be,
As it possible is in myn hous to be,	Be received to-morrow as royally
Received be to-morwe as roially	That this maiden, who shall be wedded to me,
This mayden, that shal wedded been to me,	"Griselda," said he, "my will is completely
"Grisilde," quod he, "my wyl is outrely	And reverently and wisely she greeted him.
And reverently and wisely she hym grette.	Came at his command, and on her knees set herself,
Nat with no swollen thoght in hire corage,	And she with humble heart and glad visage,
And she with humble herte and glad visage,	For that same innocent poor Griselda;
For thilke sely povre Grisildis;	Before this earl was come, sent his messenger
Er that this erl was come, sente his message	The marquis, who arranged and knew all this,
The markys, which that shoop and knew al this,	Such a noble array in all West Lombardy.
So noble array in al West Lumbardye.	That never was there seen with man's eye
That nevere was ther seyn with mannes ye	He brought with him, in such pomp and riches
He with hym broghte, in swich pompe and richesse	Was made known also that a new marchioness
Was kouth eek that a newe markysesse	And to the people's ears, one and all,
Of which the fame up sprang to moore and lesse,	From Bologna is this Earl of Panyk come,
Fro Boloigne is this Erl of Panyk come,	As women are, unless it happened recently.
As wommen been, but it be falle of newe.	As woman can, nor can be half so true
As womman kan, ne kan been half so trewe	There can no man in humility acquit himself
Ther kan no man in humblesse hym acquite	Though clerks praise women but a little,
Though clerkes preise wommen but a lite,	Especially of men, but in truth,
Namely of men, but as in soothfastnesse,	As clerks, when they want, know well how to write,
As clerkes, whan hem list, konne wel endite,	Men speak of Job, and mostly for his humility,
Men speke of Job, and moost for his humblesse,	And to her husband ever meek and stable.
Discreet and pridelees, ay honurable,	But full of patient goodness,
But ful of pacient benyngnytee,	No pomp, nor outward appearance of royalty,
No pompe, no semblant of roialtee,	No tender mouth, no self-indulgent feelings,
No tendre mouth, noon herte delicaat,	Her spirit was ever in full humility;
Hire goost was evere in pleyn humylitee;	No wonder is, for in her great estate
No wonder is, for in hire grete estaat	Had she, according to her countenance.
Ne hadde she, as by hire contenaunce.	Nor of her high estate no remembrance
Ne of hire heighe estaat no remembraunce	She showed that to her was done offence;
Ne shewed she that hire was doon offence;	Before the folk, nor also in their absence,
That neither by hire wordes ne hire face,	Dwells this flower of womanly patience,
Dwelleth this flour of wyfly pacience,	Thus with her father for a certain space of time
Thus with hire fader for a certeyn space	By many days than at her marriage.
By dayes fele than at hire mariage.	For coarse was the cloth, and more of age
For rude was the clooth, and moore of age	But on her body he could not bring it,
But on hire body myghte he it nat brynge,	He covered her, full sorrowfully weeping.
He covered hire, ful sorwefully wepynge.	And with her old coat, insofar as it could
And with hire olde coote, as it myghte be	For he by noise of folk knew her coming,
For he by noyse of folk knew hire comynge,	To meet his daughter hastily goes he,
And voyden hire as soone as ever he myghte.	To his rank so low to stoop,
To his estaat so lowe for t'alighte,	He would think it was a degradation
Hym wolde thynke it were a disparage	That when the lord had fulfilled his desires,
That whan the lord fulfild hadde his corage,	For ever he believed, since it began,
For evere he demed, sith that it bigan,	Was ever in suspicion of her marriage;
Was evere in suspect of hir mariage;	For doubtless this old poor man
For out of doute this olde poure man	Shaped him to be a living creature.
Shoop hym to been a lyves creature.	Curses the day and time that Nature
Curseth the day and tyme that Nature	Her father, who heard this news straightway,
Ne in this tyme word ne spak she noon.	But she from weeping kept her eyes dry,
But she fro wepyng kepte hire eyen dreye,	And Fortune ever they curse as they go;
And Fortune ay they cursen as they goon;	The folk follow her, weeping on their way,
The folk hire folwe, wepynge in hir weye,	Toward her father's house forth is she gone.
Toward hir fadre hous forth is she fare.	And in her smock, with head and foot all bare,
And in hir smok, with heed and foot al bare,	Before the folk she strips herself,
Biforn the folk hirselven strepeth she,	But went his way, for grief and for pity.
But wente his wey, for routhe and for pitee.	But scarcely that same word he spoke,
But wel unnethes thilke word he spak,	Let it be (there) still, and bear it forth with thee."
"The smok," quod he, "that thou hast on thy bak,	Of you, my own lord, lest I you grieve."
Of yow, myn owene lord, lest I yow greve."	Who was your wife. And here take I my leave
That was youre wyf. And heer take I my leeve	That I with it may cover the womb of her
That I therwith may wrye the wombe of here	Only such a smock as I was accustomed to wear,
But swich a smok as I was wont to were,	Condescend to give me, as my recompense,
As voucheth sauf to yeve me, to my meede,	Which I brought, and nothing I bear back,
Which that I broghte, and noght agayn I bere,	"Therefore, in recompense for my maidenhead,
"Wherfore, in gerdon of my maydenhede,	I was your wife, though I unworthy were.
I was youre wyf, though I unworthy weere.	Remember, my own lord so dear,
Lat me nat lyk a worm go by the weye.	Be seen all bare; therefore I you pray,
Be seyn al bare; wherfore I yow preye,	Should before the people, in my walking,
Sholde biforn the peple, in my walkyng,	That that same womb in which your children lay
That thilke wombe in which youre children leye	"You could not do so shameful a thing,
"Ye koude nat doon so dishonest a thyng,	That I should go without a smock out of your palace.
That I smoklees out of youre paleys wente.	But yet I hope it be not your intention
But yet I hope it be nat youre entente	All your pleasure will I eagerly follow;
Al youre plesance wol I folwen fayn;	"I came, and naked must I return.
"I cam, and naked moot I turne agayn.	Naked out of my father's house," said she,
Inwith youre chambre, dar I saufly sayn.	"The remnant of your jewels ready are
"The remenant of youre jueles redy be	And also your wedding ring, for evermore.
And eek your weddyng ryng, for everemore.	And here in return your clothing I restore,
And heere agayn your clothyng I restoore,	But faith, and nakedness, and maidenhead;
But feith, and nakednesse, and maydenhede;	To you I brought nothing else, beyond doubt,
To yow broghte I noght elles, out of drede,	And had me richly clad, by your grace.
And richely me cladden, of youre grace.	You had me stripped out of my poor clothing,
Ye dide me streepe out of my povre weede,	"My lord, you know that in my father's place
"My lord, ye woot that in my fadres place	That I gave you my heart whole heartedly.
That evere in word or werk I shal repente	Even if I were to die miserably, it shall not be
To dyen in the cas, it shal nat bee	But certainly, lord, for no adversity,
But certes, lord, for noon adversitee,	When love is old it is not the same as when it was new.
Love is noght oold as whan that it is newe.	For in fact it is proven by me --
For in effect it preeved is on me --	"But sooth is said -- always I find it true,
"But sooth is seyd -- algate I fynde it trewe,	The day that our marriage was made!
The day that maked was oure mariage!	You seemed by your speech and your visage
Ye semed by youre speche and youre visage	O good God! How gentle and how kind
O goode God! How gentil and how kynde	Which to me were hard to find now.

As I first broghte, it is wel in my mynde	"But inasmuch as you offer me such dowry
"But ther as ye me profre swich dowaire	That I shall go, I will go when you please.
That I shal goon, I wol goon whan yow leste.	"Who once was all my heart's peace,

For sith it liketh yow, my lord," quod shee,	In which I was accustomed to be blissful.

To whom she was given, heart and all,	To whom that she was yeven herte and al,
Enduring ever his desire and his pleasure,	Abidynge evere his lust and his plesance,
To endure all the adversity of Fortune,	The adversitee of Fortune al t'endure,
Disposed was, this humble creature,	Disposed was, this humble creature,
But she, continuously steadfast for evermore,	But she, ylike sad for everemo,
I believe that her heart was very woeful.	I deeme that hire herte was ful wo.
But when these tidings came to Griselda,	But whan thise tidynges came to Grisildis,
The ignorant people, as it no wonder is,	The rude peple, as it no wonder is,
Which they have published widely.	The which they han publiced atte fulle.
Between his people and him; thus said the bull,	Bitwixe his peple and hym; thus seyde the bulle,
To stint rancor and dissension	To stynte rancour and dissencion
As by the pope's dispensation,	As by the popes dispensacion,
That he has permission to leave his first wife,	That he hath leve his firste wyf to lete,
The pope's bulls, making mention	The popes bulles, makynge mencion
I say, he commanded they should counterfeit	I seye, he bad they sholde countrefete
Commanded him to wed another, if he pleased.	Bad hym to wedde another, if hym leste.
As to his cruel purpose may suffice --	As to his crueel purpos may suffyse --
Commanding them such papal bulls to devise	Comaundynge hem swiche bulles to devyse
Informed of his real purpose, sent his messenger,	Enformed of his wyl, sente his message,
He to the court of Rome, (which was) in a cunning manner	He to the court of Rome, in subtil wyse
When his daughter was twelve years of age,	Whan that his doghter twelve yeer was of age,
To test his wife was set all his intention.	To tempte his wyf was set al his entente.
Would he of his cruel purpose desist;	He of his crueel purpos nolde stente;
But nevertheless, not for any reason,	But nathelees, for ernest ne for game,
To be a murderer is (to have) a hateful reputation;	To been a mordrere is an hateful name;
Had loved him well, the disgrace of his bad reputation	Hadde loved hym wel, the sclaundre of his diffame
For which, whereas his people before this	For which, where as his peple therbifore
There came no word but that they were murdered.	Ther cam no word but that they mordred were.
No wonder is, for to the people's ear	No wonder is, for to the peples ere
Such grumbling was among them unanimously.	Swich murmur was among hem comunly.
Has murdered both his children secretly.	Hath mordred bothe his children prively.
Because he had wedded a poor woman,	For he a povre womman wedded hadde,
That of a cruel heart he wickedly,	That of a crueel herte he wikkedly,
The ill fame of Walter spread often and wide,	The sclaundre of Walter ofte and wyde spradde,
A wife, concerning herself, nothing should	A wyf, as of hirself, nothing ne sholde
She proved good; for no worldly discomfort	She shewed wel, for no worldly unreste
And, God be thanked, all fell for the best.	And, God be thanked, al fil for the beste.
The same desire was her pleasure also.	The same lust was hire plesance also.
There was but one will, for as Walter desired,	Ther nas but o wyl, for as Walter leste,
For which it seemed thus: that of them two	For which it semed thus: that of hem two
She was to him in love, and more attentive.	She was to hym in love, and moore penyble.
The more true, if it were possible,	The moore trewe, if that it were possible,
And ever the further that she was in age,	And ay the forther that she was in age,
But never could he find variation.	But nevere koude he fynde variance.
That she to him was changed in heart,	That she to hym was changed of corage,
He watches to see if by word or countenance	He waiteth if by word or contenance
To test his wife as he was first disposed.	To tempte his wyf as he was first disposed.
Right so this marquis has firmly decided	Right so this markys fulliche hath purposed
They will not from that original plan desist.	They wol nat of that firste purpos slake.
But, right as if they were bound to that stake,	But, right as they were bounden to that stake,
They can not refrain from their intention,	They kan nat stynte of hire entencion,
That when they have a certain purpose taken,	That whan they have a certein purpos take,
And he continuing ever in cruelty?	And he continuynge evere in sturdinesse?
To test her wifehood and her steadfastness,	To preeve hir wyfhod and hir stedefastnesse,
What could a cruel husband more devise	What koude a sturdy housbonde moore devyse
If these tests might not suffice?	If thise assayes myghte nat suffise?
But now I would like to ask of women	But now of wommen wolde I axen fayn
She loved her children best in every way.	She loved hir children best in every wyse.
But well he knew that next to himself, certainly,	But wel he knew that next hymself, certayn,
That she had suffered this with calm manner.	That she hadde suffred this with sad visage.
And out of malice, or for hard heart,	And of malice, or for crueel corage,
That she perfectly loved her children,	That parfitly hir children loved she,
Had not truly known before this	Ne hadde soothly knowen therbifoore
Upon her patience, and if he	Upon hir pacience, and if that he
This marquis wondered, more and more,	This markys wondred, evere lenger the moore,
But to Bologna he tenderly brought it.	But to Boloigne he tendrely it broghte.
He went his way, as if he cared nothing about it,	He wente his wey, as hym no thyng ne roghte,
But she no answer of him might have.	But she noon answere of hym myghte have.
From birds and from beasts to save.	Fro foweles and fro beestes for to save.
His tender limbs, pleasing in appearance,	His tendre lymes, delicaat to sighte,
Save this, she prayed him that, if he could,	Save this, she preyede hym that, if he myghte,
But kissed her son, and afterwards it blessed;	But kiste hir sone, and after gan it blesse;
That she made no appearance of sadness,	That she no chiere maade of hevynesse,
And continually so patient was she	And evere in oon so pacient was she
Has seized her son, that was full of beauty.	Hath hent hire sone, that ful was of beautee.
Or worse, if one can worse imagine --	Or worse, if men worse kan devyse --
That he her daughter seized, right so he --	That he hire doghter caughte, right so he --
This ugly sergeant, in the same manner	This ugly sergeant, in the same wyse
But to his heart it was full great pleasure.	But to his herte it was ful greet plesance.
In patience suffer all this treatment;	In pacience suffre al this array;
His eyes two, and wonders that she can	His eyen two, and wondreth that she may
The constancy of his wife, he cast down	The constance of his wyf, he caste adoun
Unto your love." And when this marquis saw	Unto youre love." And whan this markys say
"Death can not make any comparison (is nothing compared)	"Deth may noght make no comparisoun
Right gladly would I die, to please you.	Right gladly wolde I dyen, yow to plese.
For if I knew that my death would do you ease,	For wiste I that my deeth wolde do yow ese,
All your pleasure (whatever you wish) firm and stable I hold;	Al youre plesance ferme and stable I holde;
But now I know your desire, and what you want,	But now I woot youre lust, and what ye wolde,
To know your will, before you told me your desire,	Youre wyl to knowe, er ye youre lust me tolde,
"And certainly, if I had foreknowledge	"And certes, if I hadde prescience
Do your pleasure; I will obey your desire.	Dooth youre plesaunce; I wol youre lust obeye.
And took your clothing; wherefore I you pray,	And took youre clothyng; wherfore I yow preye,
"Left I my will and all my liberty,	"Lefte I my wyl and al my libertee,
When I first came to you, right so," said she,	Whan I first cam to yow, right so," quod she,
For as I left at home all my clothing,	For as I lefte at hoom al my clothyng,
Right as you desire; ask no advice from me.	Right as yow list; axeth no reed at me.
"You are our lord; do with your own thing	"Ye been oure lord; dooth with youre owene thyng
I have not had any part of children two	I have noght had no part of children tweyne
At your commandment, this is to say.	At youre comandement, this is to sayn.
Though my daughter and my son be slain --	Though that my doughter and my sone be slayn --
But as you desire. It does not grieve me at all,	But as yow list. Naught greveth me at al,
I want nothing, nor will not want any thing, certainly,	I wol no thyng, ne nyl no thyng, certayn,
"I have," said she, "said thus, and ever shall:	"I have," quod she, "seyd thus, and evere shal:
Be patient, and for that I pray you."	Beth pacient, and therof I yow preye."
For any woe should break out in a passion;	Out of youreself for no wo sholde outreye;
This I warn you, so that you not suddenly	This warne I yow, that ye nat sodeynly
As I dealt with his sister by night,	As I his suster servede by nyghte,
Therefore I am firmly resolved,	Wherfore I am disposed outrely,
"I would live in peace, if I could;	"I wolde lyve in pees, if that I myghte;
Though they speak not plainly in my hearing.	Though they nat pleyn speke in myn audience.
For certainly I dread such opinion,	For certeinly I drede swich sentence,
Well ought I of such grumbling take heed,	Wel oughte I of swich murmur taken heede,
Such words say my people, no doubt.	Swiche wordes seith my peple, out of drede.
And be our lord, for we have no other.'	And been oure lord, for oother have we noon.'
Then shall the blood of Janicle succeed	Thanne shal the blood of Janicle succede
That it well nigh has destroyed my heart.	That it wel ny destroyed hath myn herte.
For to my ears comes the voice so sharply	For to myne eres comth the voys so smerte
The grumbling slays my heart and my feelings,	The murmur sleeth myn herte and my corage,
Now is it worse than ever in all our lives.	Now is it worse than evere in al oure age.
And especially since my son is born,	And namely sith my sone yboren is,
My people are unhappy with our marriage;	My peple sikly berth oure mariage;
"Wife," said this marquis, "you have heard before this	"Wyf," quod this markys, "ye han herd er this
When they find a patient creature.	Whan that they fynde a pacient creature.
But wedded men know no moderation,	But wedded men ne knowe no mesure,
To test his wife yet again, if he can.	To tempte his wyf yet ofter, if he may.
This marquis caught yet another desire	This markys caughte yet another lest
Of his nurse weaned, on one day	Departed of his norice, on a day
When it was two years old, and from the breast	Whan it was two yeer old, and fro the brest
Was for this child, and God they thank and praise.	Was for this child, and God they thanke and herye.
Not only he but all his country merry	Nat oonly he but al his contree merye
And when folk told it to his father,	And whan that folk it to his fader tolde,
Very gracious and beautiful in appearance.	Ful gracious and fair for to biholde.
A male child she bore by this Walter,	A knave child she bar by this Walter,
In this condition there are passed four years	In this estaat ther passed been foure yeer
Mentioned she, in earnest nor in jest (in any way).	Ne nempned she, in ernest nor in game.
Was seen in her, and never her daughter's name	Was seyn in hire, ne nevere hir doghter name
No external sign, for any adversity,	Noon accident, for noon adversitee,
Nor of her daughter not a word spoke she.	Ne of hir doghter noght a word spak she.
Was she to him in every sort of way;	Was she to hym in every maner wyse;
And also in love, as she was accustomed to be,	And eek in love, as she was wont to be,
As glad, as humble, as diligent in service,	As glad, as humble, as bisy in servyse,
Anything but always the same, alike steadfast and kind.	But evere in oon ylike sad and kynde.
Or by her word perceive, if she	Or by hire word aperceyve, that she
If by his wife's appearance he might see,	If by his wyves cheere he myghte se,
For now he goes very intently considering	For now gooth he ful faste ymaginyng
But to this marquis we now return.	But to this markys now retourne we.
The sergeant goes, and has fulfilled this order;	The sergeant gooth, and hath fulfild this thyng;
From every person, for anything that may happen.	From every wight, for oght that may bityde.
And whose child that it was he commanded her to hide	And whos child that it was he bad hire hyde
This child to nurture in all noble manners;	This child to fostre in alle gentillesse;
Beseeching her to do her best	Bisekynge hire to doon hire bisynesse
Who at that very time was countess of Panik,	That thilke tyme of Panik was countesse,
But at Bologna to his sister dear,	But at Boloigne to his suster deere,
Nor whence he came, nor whither he went;	Ne whenne he cam, ne whider that he wente;
No man should know of his intention,	That no man sholde knowe of his entente,
But, upon pain of having his head cut off,	But, upon peyne his heed of for to swappe,
And carry it in a box or in a folded cloth;	And carie it in a cofre or in a lappe;
With every care tenderly,	With alle circumstances tendrely,
Should this child softly wind and wrap (in a blanket),	Sholde this child softe wynde and wrappe,
And commanded this sergeant that he secretly	And bad this sergeant that he pryvely
But nevertheless his purpose held he still,	But nathelees his purpos heeld he stille,
Somewhat this lord had pity in his manner,	Somwhat this lord hadde routhe in his manere,
And presents him with his daughter dear.	And hym presenteth with his doghter deere.
He told him in detail, in short and plain (words),	He tolde hym point for point, in short and pleyn,
And of Griselda's words and her manner	And of Grisildis wordes and hire cheere
This sergeant came unto his lord again,	This sergeant cam unto his lord ageyn,
But took the child and went upon his way.	But took the child and wente upon his weye.
But he no word will say to that proposal,	But he no word wol to that purpos seye,
That no beasts nor birds tear it to pieces."	That beestes ne no briddes it torace."
That, unless my lord forbad you, at the least	That, but my lord forbad yow, atte leeste
But one thing will I pray you of your grace,	But o thyng wol I prey yow of youre grace,
"Go now," said she, "and do my lord's command;	"Gooth now," quod she, "and dooth my lordes heeste;
"Have here again your little young maid.	"Have heer agayn youre litel yonge mayde.
And to the sergeant meekly she said,	And to the sergeant mekely she sayde,
That she endured all adversity,	That she endured al adversitee,
But nevertheless so firmly steadfast was she	But nathelees so sad stidefast was she
Well might a mother then have cried "alas!"	Wel myghte a mooder thanne han cryd "allas!"
It would have been hard this pitiful situation to see;	It had been hard this reuthe for to se;
For this night shalt thou die for my sake."	For this nyght shaltow dyen for my sake."
Thy soul, little child, I entrust to him,	Thy soule, litel child, I hym bitake,
That for us died upon a cross of wood,	That for us deyde upon a croys of tree,
Of that same Father -- blessed may he be! --	Of thilke Fader -- blessed moote he be! --
But since I have marked thee with the cross	But sith I thee have marked with the croys
"Farewell my child! I shall thee never see.	"Fareweel my child! I shal thee nevere see.
And thus she said in her benign voice,	And thus she seyde in hire benigne voys,
And lulled it, and afterward kissed it.	And lulled it, and after gan it kisse.
With full sad face, and blessed the child,	With ful sad face, and gan the child to blisse,
That she might kiss her child before it died.	That she moste kisse hire child er that it deyde.
As he was a worthy gentle man,	So as he was a worthy gentil man,
And meekly she to the sergeant prayed,	And mekely she to the sergeant preyde,
But at the last she began to speak,	But atte laste to speken she bigan,
Conforming herself to what the marquis pleased.	Conformynge hire to that the markys lyked.
But nevertheless she neither wept nor sighed,	But nathelees she neither weep ne syked,
She thought he would have slain it right then.	She wende he wolde han slawen it right tho.
Alas! Her daughter that she loved so,	Allas! Hir doghter that she loved so,
Suspect the time in which he this began.	Suspect the tyme in which he this bigan.
Suspicious was the bad reputation of this man,	Suspecious was the diffame of this man,
And let this cruel sergeant do his will.	And leet this crueel sergeant doon his wille.
And as a lamb she sits meek and still,	And as a lamb she sitteth meke and stille,
Griselda must suffer all and consent to all,	Grisildis moot al suffre and al consente,
As if he would have slain it before he went.	As though he wolde han slayn it er he wente.
Mercilessly, and made a face	Despitously, and gan a cheere make
And spoke no more, but out the child he seized	And spak namoore, but out the child he hente
"This child I am commanded to take" --	"This child I am comanded for to take" --
And so will I; there is no more to say.	And so wol I; ther is namoore to seye.
They may well be bewailed or complained of,	They mowe wel been biwailled or compleyned,
That lords' commands may not be evaded (by feigning);	That lordes heestes mowe nat been yfeyned;
You are so wise that full well you know	Ye been so wys that ful wel knowe ye
Though I do a thing to which I am constrained.	Though I do thyng to which I am constreyned.
"Madame," he said, "you must forgive it me,	"Madame," he seyde, "ye moote foryeve it me,
Into the chamber he stalked very quietly.	Into the chambre he stalked hym ful stille.
And when this sergeant knew his lord's will,	And whan this sergeant wiste his lordes wille,
The lord knew well that he loved and dreaded him;	The lord knew wel that he hym loved and dradde;
Carry out their orders in evil matters.	Doon execucioun in thynges badde.
Whom he had often found faithful	The which that feithful ofte he founden hadde
A sort of sergeant (policeman) was this confidential servant,	A maner sergeant was this privee man,
Unto a man, and sent him to his wife.	Unto a man, and to his wyf hym sente.
He privately has told all his plan	He prively hath toold al his entente
Soon after this, in a few minutes,	Soone after this, a furlong wey or two,
When he had to go out of the chamber.	Whan that he sholde out of the chambre go.
All sorrowful was his manner and his look,	Al drery was his cheere and his lookyng,
But yet he feigned as if he were not so;	But yet he feyned as he were nat so;
Glad was this marquis of her answer,	Glad was this markys of hire answeryng,
No length of time or death can obliterate this,	No lengthe of tyme or deeth may this deface,
This will is in my heart, and ever shall be;	This wyl is in myn herte, and ay shal be;
Nor dread to lose, save only you.	Ne drede for to leese, save oonly yee.
Nor do I desire to have anything,	Ne I desire no thyng for to have,
Please you that may displease me;	Liken to yow that may displese me;
"There can nothing, as God my soul may save,	"Ther may no thyng, God so my soule save,
Your own thing; do as you will.	Youre owene thyng; werketh after youre wille.
Are entirely yours, and you may save or kill	Been youres al, and ye mowe save or spille
My child and I, with heart-felt obedience,	My child and I, with hertely obeisaunce,
For, as it seemed, she was not aggrieved.	For, as it semed, she was nat agreved.
Neither in word, nor manner, nor countenance,	Neither in word, or chiere, or contenaunce,
When she had heard all this, she changed not	Whan she had herd al this, she noght ameved
That day that our marriage was made."	That day that maked was oure mariage."
That you promised me and swore in your village	That ye me highte and swore in youre village
Show now in your actions your patience,	Shewe now youre pacience in youre werkyng,
"That you assent to me in this matter.	"That ye to me assente as in this thyng.
I will not do anything; but this I desire," said he,	I wol nat doon; but this wol I," quod he,
But nevertheless without your knowledge	But nathelees withoute youre wityng
Not as I would want, but as my people desire.	Nat as I wolde, but as my peple leste.
I must do with thy daughter for the best,	I moot doon with thy doghter for the beste,
I can not be imprudent in this case;	I may nat in this caas be recchelees;
To live my life with them in rest and peace.	To lyve my lyf with hem in reste and pees.
But I desire, as I have done before,	But I desire, as I have doon bifore,
These words have they spoken, doubtless.	Thise wordes han they spoken, doutelees.
"And especially since thy daughter was born	"And namely sith thy doghter was ybore
To thee, that art born in a humble village.	To thee, that born art of a smal village.
To be subjects and be in servitude	For to be subgetz and been in servage
Unto my nobles you are not at all so.	Unto my gentils ye be no thyng so.
And though to me you are beloved and dear,	And though to me that ye be lief and deere,
Into this house, it is not long ago;	Into this hous, it is nat longe ago;
"You know well yourself how you came here	"Ye woot youreself wel how that ye cam heere
There is no person that hears it but we two.	Ther is no wight that hereth it but we tweye.
Take heed of every word that I say to you;	Taak heede of every word that y yow seye;
Despite any present prosperity you must know it yourself.	For any wele ye moot youreselven knowe.
That I took you in a poor, very humble condition,	That I yow took in povre estaat ful lowe,
Requires that you be not forgetful	Maketh yow nat foryetful for to be
"I say, Griselda, this present high social position,	"I seye, Grisilde, this present dignitee,
You have not forgotten that, as I suppose?	Ye have nat that forgeten, as I gesse?
And put you in the condition of high nobility --	And putte yow in estaat of heigh noblesse --
That I took you out of your impoverished situation,	That I yow took out of youre povere array,
And said thus: "Griselda," said he, "that day	And seyde thus: "Grisilde," quod he, "that day
With stern face and with a very troubled manner,	With stierne face and with ful trouble cheere,
He came alone at night, where she lay,	He cam allone a-nyght, ther as she lay,
For which this marquis worked in this manner:	For which this markys wroghte in this manere:
And put her in anguish and in dread.	And putten hire in angwyssh and in drede.
But as for me, I say that it ill befits one	But as for me, I seye that yvele it sit
Though some men praise its ingenuity?	Though som men preise it for a subtil wit?
To test her, and always more and more,	Hire for to tempte, and alwey moore and moore,
And found her always good; why was it needed	And foond hire evere good; what neded it
He had tested her enough before,	He hadde assayed hire ynogh bifore,
Needless, God knows, he intended to frighten her.	Nedelees, God woot, he thoghte hire for t'affraye.
This strange desire to test his wife;	This merveillous desir his wyf t'assaye;
That he could not out of his heart throw	That he ne myghte out of his herte throwe
To test his wife, her constancy to know,	To tempte his wyf, hir sadnesse for to knowe,
When this child had suckled but a short time,	Whan that this child had souked but a throwe,
There happened, as it befalls many times,	Ther fil, as it bifalleth tymes mo,
By likelihood, since she is not barren.	By liklihede, syn she nys nat bareyne.
She may unto a male child attain	She may unto a knave child atteyne
For though a maid child came all before,	For though a mayde child coome al bifore,
Glad was this marquis and the folk for this,	Glad was this markys and the folk therfore,
Although she would rather have given birth to a male child;	Al had hire levere have born a knave child;
Was married, she has borne a daughter,	Was wedded, she a doghter hath ybore,
Not long time after this Griselda	Nat longe tyme after that this Grisild
That she was sent from heaven, as men supposed,	That she from hevene sent was, as men wende,
And judgments of such great justice,	And juggementz of so greet equitee,
Such wise and well considered words had she,	So wise and rype wordes hadde she,
Were wroth, she would bring them to agreement;	Were wrothe, she wolde bryngen hem aton;
If noble men or others of her country	If gentil men or othere of hire contree
Though her husband was absent at the time,	Though that hire housbonde absent were anon,
And wisely bring them all in rest and ease.	And wisely brynge hem alle in reste and ese.
In all that land that she could not alleviate,	In al that land that she ne koude apese,
There was no discord, rancor, nor sadness	Ther nas discord, rancour, ne hevynesse
But also, when the situation required it,	But eek, whan that the cas required it,
Knew all the skills of a housewife's duties,	Koude al the feet of wyfly hoomlinesse,
Not only this Griselda through her wit	Nat oonly this Grisildis thurgh hir wit
A prudent man, and that is seen full seldom.	A prudent man, and that is seyn ful seelde.
Was often virtue hid, the people considered him	Was ofte vertu hid, the peple hym heelde
And because he saw that under low social rank	And for he saugh that under low degree
At home, and to all appearances he had sufficient happiness;	At hoom, and outward grace ynogh had he;
In God's peace lives full easily	In Goddes pees lyveth ful esily
Wedded with beneficial virtue,	Wedded with fortunat honestetee,
Go to Saluce to look upon her.	Goon to Saluce upon hire to biholde.
That men and women, as well young as old,	That men and wommen, as wel yonge as olde,
So spread the fame of her high goodness	So spradde of hire heighe bountee the fame
If one said well, another said the same;	If oon seide wel, another seyde the same;
But also moreover in many a region,	But eek biside in many a regioun,
Was made known the praise of her name,	Publiced was the bountee of hir name,
Not only in the town of Saluces	Noght oonly of Saluces in the toun
That each who looked on her face loved her.	That ech hire lovede that looked on hir face.
And could so the people's heart embrace,	And koude so the peples herte embrace,
And so discreet and fair of eloquence,	And so discreet and fair of eloquence,
Of good characteristics, set in high goodness,	Of thewes goode, yset in heigh bountee,
She was increased in such excellence	She was encressed in swich excellence
For though that she was always virtuous,	For though that evere vertuous was she,
They thought she was another creature.	Hem thoughte she was another creature.
She was daughter, for, by conjecture,	She doghter were, for, as by conjecture,
That to Janicle, of whom I spoke before,	That to Janicle, of which I spak bifore,
They hardly believed -- but dared have sworn --	Unnethe trowed they -- but dorste han swore --
And from her birth knew her year by year,	And from hire birthe knewe hire yeer by yeere,
To every person she is grown so dear	To every wight she woxen is so deere
But nurtured in an emperor's hall.	But norissed in an emperoures halle.
In a peasant's hut or in an ox-stall,	As in a cote or in an oxe-stalle,
That she was born and fed in humble circumstances,	That she was born and fed in rudenesse,
That it seemed not likely	That it ne semed nat by liklynesse
God has such favor sent her of his grace	God hath swich favour sent hire of his grace
I say that to this new marchioness	I seye that to this newe markysesse
And shortly forth this tale to pursue,	And shortly forth this tale for to chace,
In revel, until the sun descended.	In revel, til the sonne gan descende.
With joyful people that led and met her,	With joyful peple that hire ladde and mette,
And to his palace, before he longer delayed,	And to his paleys, er he lenger lette,
Upon a horse, snow-white and with a gentle pace,	Upon an hors, snow-whit and wel amblyng,
Brought for the same purpose, and then set her	Broght for the same cause, and thanne hire sette
This marquis has espoused her with a ring	This markys hath hire spoused with a ryng
When she was translated into such riches.	Whan she translated was in swich richesse.
The hardly people knew her for her beauty	Unnethe the peple hir knew for hire fairnesse
Of her appearance why should I make a long tale?	Of hire array what sholde I make a tale?
And set her garments full of jeweled ornaments of every sort.	And sette hire ful of nowches grete and smale.
Very crudely, and with their elegant fingers	Ful rudely, and with hir fyngres smale
Her hair have they combed, that lay unkempt	Hir heris han they kembd, that lay untressed
From foot to head they have clothed all new.	Fro foot to heed they clothed han al newe.
But nevertheless, this maid bright of hue	But nathelees, this mayde bright of hewe
To handle her clothes, in which she was clad.	To handle hir clothes, wherinne she was clad.
Of which these ladies were not very happy	Of which thise ladyes were nat right glad
That women should undress her right there;	That wommen sholde dispoillen hire right theere;
She should bring into his house, he ordered	She sholde brynge into his hous, he bad
And so that nothing of her old belongings	And for that no thyng of hir olde geere
Honor her and love her, I pray,	Honoureth hire and loveth hire, I preye,
"This is my wife," said he, "that stands here.	"This is my wyf," quod he, "that standeth heere.
And to the people he said in this manner:	And to the peple he seyde in this manere:
Out of the door, and after that came she,	Out at the dore, and after that cam she,
And forth he goes with a full sober manner	And forth he gooth with a ful sobre cheere
"This is enough, Griselda mine," said he.	"This is ynogh, Grisilde myn," quod he.
Even to be dead, though I would hate to die."	For to be deed, though me were looth to deye."
In deed nor thought, will I disobey you,	In werk ne thoght, I nyl yow disobeye,
And here I swear that never willingly,	And heere I swere that nevere willyngly,
Am I of that same honor that you offer me,	Am I to thilke honour that ye me beede,
She said, "Lord, unsuitable and unworthy	She seyde, "Lord, undigne and unworthy
Wondering upon these words, trembling for fear,	Wondrynge upon this word, quakynge for drede,
Swear this, and here I swear our alliance."	Swere this, and heere I swere oure alliance."
Neither by word nor frowning countenance?	Neither by word ne frownyng contenance?
And also when I say `yes,' say not `nay,'	And eek whan I sey `ye,' ne sey nat `nay,'
And you never to grouch about it, at any time?	And nevere ye to grucche it, nyght ne day?
As seems best to me, make you laugh or feel pain,	As me best thynketh, do yow laughe or smerte,
To all my desires, and that I freely may,	To al my lust, and that I frely may,
Will you assent, or else think it over?	Wol ye assente, or elles yow avyse?
"That, since it shall be done in a hasty manner,	"That, sith it shal be doon in hastif wyse,
But these questions ask I first," said he,	But thise demandes axe I first," quod he,
As I suppose, that you desire that it so be.	As I suppose, ye wol that it so be.
That I you wed, and also it may so stand,	That I yow wedde, and eek it may so stonde,
It is pleasing to your father and to me	It liketh to youre fader and to me
"Griselda," he said, "you shall well understand	"Grisilde," he seyde, "ye shal wel understonde
To this benign, true, faithful maid:	To this benigne, verray, feithful mayde:
These are the words that the marquis said	Thise arn the wordes that the markys sayde
For which she looked full pale in her face.	For which she looked with ful pale face.
She never was accustomed to such guests,	She nevere was to swiche gestes woned,
To see so great a guest come in that place;	To seen so greet a gest come in that place;
Though it is no wonder that she was astonished	No wonder is thogh that she were astoned
For never before saw she such a sight.	For nevere erst ne saugh she swich a sighte.
But certainly Griselda might wonder,	But outrely Grisildis wondre myghte,
And how attentively she cared for her dear father.	And tentifly she kepte hir fader deere.
And wondered in what a virtuous manner	And wondred hem in how honest manere
The people came unto outside the house,	The peple cam unto the hous withoute,
And in the chamber, while they were engaged in	And in the chambre, whil they were aboute
I will say nothing out of thy hearing."	I wol noght speke out of thyn audience."
And all this shall be done in thy presence;	And al this shal be doon in thy presence;
To be my wife and conduct herself as I decide.	To be my wyf and reule hire after me.
For I will ask if it be her will	For I wol axe if it hire wille be
Have a discussion, and knowest thou why?	Have a collacioun, and wostow why?
"That in thy chamber I and thou and she	"That in thy chambre I and thou and she
"Yet I want," said this marquis softly,	"Yet wol I," quod this markys softely,
Right as you please, govern this matter."	Right as yow lust, governeth this mateere."
Is as you wish, and against your pleasure	Is as ye wole, ne ayeynes youre likynge
But only thus: "Lord," said he, "my desire	But oonly thus: "Lord," quod he, "my willynge
He stood; hardly said he any more words,	He stood; unnethes seyde he wordes mo,
That he grew red; abashed and all trembling	That reed he wax; abayst and al quakynge
This sudden occurrence this man so astounded	This sodeyn cas this man astonyed so
To take me for thy son-in-law."	To take me as for thy sone-in-lawe."
If thou will agree with that proposal,	If that thou wolt unto that purpos drawe,
Tell me of that question that I have stated previously,	Tel me that poynt that I have seyd bifore,
It pleases thee, and specially therefore	It liketh thee, and specially therfore
And art my faithful liege man born,	And art my feithful lige man ybore,
"Thou lovest me, I know it well for certain,	"Thou lovest me, I woot it wel certeyn,
For my wife, until her life's end.	As for my wyf, unto hir lyves ende.
Thy daughter will I take, before I depart,	Thy doghter wol I take, er that I wende,
If thou agree, whatsoever may happen,	If that thou vouche sauf, what so bityde,
Longer hide the desire of my heart.	Lenger the plesance of myn herte hyde.
"Janicula, I neither may nor can	"Janicula, I neither may ne kan
And said thus, when he had him aside:	And seyde thus, whan he hym hadde asyde:
He by the hand then took this old man,	He by the hand thanne took this olde man,
And in she goes without longer delay,	And in she gooth withouten lenger lette,
Answered, "Lord, he is right here."	Answerde, "Lord, he is al redy heere."
And she with reverence, in humble manner,	And she with reverence, in humble cheere,
"Where is your father, O Griselda?" he said.	"Where is youre fader, O Grisildis?" he sayde.
Full soberly, and said in this manner:	Ful sobrely, and seyde in this manere:
This pensive marquis spoke unto this maid	This thoghtful markys spak unto this mayde
Until she had heard what was the lord's will.	Til she had herd what was the lordes wille.
And with sober countenance kneels without speaking,	And with sad contenance kneleth stille,
And down upon her knees she fell,	And doun upon hir knes she gan to falle,
And she set down her water pot quickly,	And she set doun hir water pot anon,
The marquis came and called her;	The markys cam and gan hire for to calle;
And as she would over her threshold go,	And as she wolde over hir threshold gon,
If she takes this way to the castle."	If she this wey unto the castel holde."
And then I may at leisure her behold,	And thanne I may at leyser hire biholde,
The chores that I must do,	The labour which that longeth unto me,
To do at home, as soon as it can be,	To doon at hoom, as soone as it may be,
The marchioness, and therefore will I try	The markysesse, and therfore wol I fonde
Who are my fellows, in our door and see	That been my felawes, in oure dore and se
She would be happy to have seen some of that sight.	She wolde fayn han seyn som of that sighte.
The marquis should wed, and if she could,	The markys sholde wedde, and if she myghte,
For well she had heard said that same day	For wel she hadde herd seyd that thilke day
And comes home as soon as ever she can;	And cometh hoom as soone as ever she may;
Has gone to fetch water at a well,	To fecchen water at a welle is went,
That for her was all this splendour prepared,	That for hire shapen was al this array,
Griselda of this, God knows, full ignorant,	Grisilde of this, God woot, ful innocent,
In this splendid array the direct route have held.	In this array the righte wey han holde.
Unto the village of which I told	Unto the village of the which I tolde
And of his retinue the knights,	And of his retenue the bachelrye,
Who were invited to the feast,	The whiche that to the feeste weren yprayed,
Lords and ladies in his company,	Lordes and ladyes in his compaignye,
This royal marquis, richly arrayed,	This roial markys, richely arrayed,
What can be found from as far as farthest Italy.	That may be founde as fer as last Ytaille.
There canst thou see, of delicious foods	Ther maystow seen, of deyntevous vitaille
Storage buildings stuffed with plenty,	Houses of office stuffed with plentee
Both hall and chambers, each in its turn;	Bothe halle and chambres, ech in his degree;
And all the palace was put in proper order,	And al the paleys put was in array,
The time of mid-morning of the same day	The time of undren of the same day
That unto such a wedding should be appropriate.	That unto swich a weddyng sholde falle.
And also of all other ornaments	And eek of othere aornementes alle
By a maid like her (in) stature,	By a mayde lyk to hire stature,
And of her clothing he took the measure	And of hir clothyng took he the mesure
Brooches and rings, for Griselda's sake;	Brooches and rynges, for Grisildis sake;
Of gems, set in gold and in azure,	Of gemmes, set in gold and in asure,
But nevertheless this marquis has made	But nathelees this markys hath doon make
Why will he thus himself and us deceive?"	Why wole he thus hymself and us bigile?"
"Will not our lord yet leave his vanity?	"Wol nat oure lord yet leve his vanytee?
And said, when they were in private,	And seyden, whan they were in privetee,
For which marvel wondered many a man,	For which merveille wondred many a man,
Tell what woman it should be;	Telle what womman that it sholde be;
The day of wedding came, but no person can	The day of weddyng cam, but no wight kan
Wed her only, if ever he should wed.	Wedde hire oonly, if evere he wedde sholde.
Her goodness, and decided that he would	Hir bountee, and disposed that he wolde
In virtue, he considered very carefully	In vertu, he considered ful right
For though the people have no great insight	For thogh the peple have no greet insight
And also her virtue, passing any person	And eek hir vertu, passynge any wight
Commending in his heart her womanly qualities,	Commendynge in his herte hir wommanhede,
Upon her demeanor he would often think,	Upon hir chiere he wolde hym ofte avyse,
His eyes cast on hire, but in serious manner	His eyen caste on hire, but in sad wyse
He not with lecherous looking of folly	He noght with wantown lookyng of folye
And when it happened that he might see her,	And whan it fil that he myghte hire espye,
By chance, as he on hunting rode;	As he on huntyng rood paraventure;
Very many times this marquis set his eye	Ful ofte sithe this markys sette his ye
Upon Griselda, this poor creature,	Upon Grisilde, this povre creature,
With every obedience and diligence	With everich obeisaunce and diligence
And ever she sustained her father's life	And ay she kepte hir fadres lyf on-lofte
And made her bed full hard and not at all soft;	And made hir bed ful hard and nothyng softe;
Which she shredded and boiled for their sustenance	The whiche she shredde and seeth for hir lyvynge,
Cabbages or other greens very often,	Wortes or othere herbes tymes ofte,
And when she homeward came, she would bring	And whan she homward cam, she wolde brynge
She would not be idle until she slept.	She wolde noght been ydel til she slepte.
A few sheep, while spinning, on field she kept;	A fewe sheep, spynnynge, on feeld she kepte;
Her old poor father she cared for.	Hir olde povre fader fostred shee.
There was enclosed a mature and steadfast spirit;	Ther was enclosed rype and sad corage;
Yet in the breast of her virginity	Yet in the brest of hire virginitee
But though this maid was tender of age,	But thogh this mayde tendre were of age,
She knew well labor but no idle ease.	She knew wel labour but noon ydel ese.
She drank, and because she would satisfy the demands of virtue	She drank, and for she wolde vertu plese,
Much more often of the well than of the wine barrel	Wel ofter of the welle than of the tonne
No sensual desire had run through her heart.	No likerous lust was thurgh hire herte yronne.
Because she was raised in poverty,	For povreliche yfostred up was she,
Then was she the fairest of all under sun;	Thanne was she oon the faireste under sonne;
And Griselda this young maiden was called.	And Grisildis this yonge mayden highte.
A daughter had he, fair enough in appearance,	A doghter hadde he, fair ynogh to sighte,
Janicula men of that village call him.	Janicula men of that throop hym calle.
His grace into a little ox's stall;	His grace into a litel oxes stalle;
But high God sometimes can send	But hye God somtyme senden kan
Who was considered poorest of them all;	Which that was holden povrest of hem alle;
Among these poor folk there dwelt a man	Amonges thise povre folk ther dwelte a man
According to what produce the earth gave them.	After that the erthe yaf hem habundance.
And of their labor took their sustenance,	And of hire labour tooke hir sustenance,
In which poor folk of that village	In which that povre folk of that village
There stood a small village, in a delightful location,	There stood a throop, of site delitable,
Where this marquis planned his marriage,	Wher as this markys shoop his mariage,
Not far from that same noble palace,	Noght fer fro thilke paleys honurable,
To lend honor unto the feast.	To doon unto the feeste reverence.
And each of them does all his efforts	And ech of hem dooth al his diligence
And they to his commandment obey,	And they to his comandement obeye,
Gave such orders as he desired to lay on them;	Swich charge yaf as hym liste on hem leye;
And to his household knights and squires	And to his privee knyghtes and squieres
And thereupon he to his officers	And heerupon he to his officeres
In accord with their wishes, and home again they go.	Of hire entente, and hoom agayn they wende.
All thanked him; and thus they have a conclusion	Hym thonken alle; and thus they han an ende
Kneeling upon their knees full reverently,	Knelynge upon hir knees ful reverently,
And they, with humble good will, obediently,	And they, with humble entente, buxomly,
And said he did all this at their request.	And seyde he dide al this at hir requeste.
On which he would be wedded surely,	On which he wolde be wedded sikerly,
He granted them a day, such as he pleased,	He graunted hem a day, swich as hym leste,
Lest the marquis no wife would wed.	Lest that the markys no wyf wolde wedde.
Of his wedding, as soon as ever he can;	Of his spousaille, as soone as evere he may;
That he would grant them a fixed day	That he wolde graunten hem a certein day
Beseeching him of grace, before they went,	Bisekynge hym of grace, er that they wenten,
To all this thing -- there said no person nay --	To al this thyng -- ther seyde no wight nay --
With heartfelt will they swore and assent	With hertely wyl they sworen and assenten
I pray you, speak no more of this matter."	I prey yow, speketh namoore of this matere."
And unless you will assent in such a manner,	And but ye wole assente in swich manere,
Where my heart is set, there will I take a wife;	Ther as myn herte is set, ther wol I wyve;
At your request, as ever I may thrive,	At youre requeste, as evere moot I thryve,
Against my choice shall neither grouch nor strive;	Agayn my choys shul neither grucche ne stryve;
"And furthermore, this shall you swear: that you	"And forthermoore, this shal ye swere: that ye
As if she were an emperor's daughter.	As she an emperoures doghter weere.
In word and deed, both here and everywhere,	In word and werk, bothe heere and everywheere,
To honor her, while her life may endure,	To worshipe hire, whil that hir lyf may dure,
Whatever wife I take, you me assure	What wyf that I take, ye me assure
But I you pray, and order you upon your life,	But I yow preye, and charge upon youre lyf,
That responsibility upon my back I will endure.	That charge upon my bak I wole endure.
"Let me alone in the choosing of my wife --	"Lat me allone in chesynge of my wyf --

To choose me a wife, I release you	To chese me a wyf, I yow relesse
But insofar as you have offered me to-day	But ther as ye han profred me to-day
Therefore of my free will I will assent	Wherfore of my free wyl I wole assente
And trust upon your intelligence, and always have done so;	And truste upon youre wit, and have doon ay;
"But nevertheless I see your true intent,	"But nathelees I se youre trewe entente,
Where I was free, I must be in servitude.	Ther I was free, I moot been in servage.
That seldom is found in marriage;	That seelde tyme is founde in mariage;
I rejoiced in my liberty,	I me rejoysed of my liberte,
That which I never before thought to compel myself.	To that I nevere erst thoughte streyne me.
"You want," said he, "my own people dear,	"Ye wol," quod he, "myn owene peple deere,
Made the marquis's heart have pity.	Made the markys herte han pitee.
Wherefore we pray you hastily to take a wife."	Wherfore we pray you hastily to wyve."
Your heritage, O woe would it be to us in our lifetime!	Youre heritage, O wo were us alyve!
And that a foreign successor should take	And that a straunge successour sholde take
That through your death your line should die out,	That thurgh youre deeth youre lyne sholde slake,
For if it so happen, may God forbid,	For if it so bifelle, as God forbede,
And take a wife, for high God's sake!	And taak a wyf, for hye Goddes sake!
"Deliver us out of all this constant fear,	"Delivere us out of al this bisy drede,
Honor to God and you, so far as we can judge.	Honour to God and yow, as we kan deeme.

"Sir Clerk of Oxford," our Host said,	"Sire Clerk of Oxenford," oure Hooste sayde,
A shop, and screwed for her living.	A shoppe, and swyved for hir sustenance.
And had a wife that kept for the sake of appearances	And hadde a wyf that heeld for contenance
Who loved dicing, and revelling, and having fun,	That lovede dys, and revel, and disport,
Unto a companion of his own sort,	Unto a compeer of his owene sort,
Right away he sent his bed and his clothing	Anon he sente his bed and his array
That which he can steal or may borrow,	Of that he brybe kan or borwe may,
And because there is no thief without an accomplice,	And for ther is no theef withoute a lowke,
Now let him revel all the night or leave off (do as he chooses).	Now lat hym riote al the nyght or leve.
And thus this jolly apprentice had his leave.	And thus this joly prentys hadde his leve.
And ordered him to go, with sorrow and with bad luck!	And bad hym go, with sorwe and with meschance!
Therefore his master gave him his certificate,	Therfore his maister yaf hym acquitance,
Than that he should ruin all the servants in the place.	Than he shende alle the servantz in the place.
It is much less harm to let him go away,	It is ful lasse harm to lete hym pace,
So fares it with a debauched servant;	So fareth it by a riotous servaunt;
Than that it rot al the remnant."	Than that it rotie al the remenaunt."
A proverb that says this same word:	Of a proverbe that seith this same word:

But at the last his master remembered,	But atte laste his maister hym bithoghte,
And sometimes taken (as a prisoner) with music to Newgate prison.	And somtyme lad with revel to Newegate.
Although he was rebuked both early and late,	Al were he snybbed bothe erly and late,
Until he was nearly out of his apprenticeship,	Til he were ny out of his prentishood,
This jolly apprentice with his master remained,	This joly prentys with his maister bood,
Are always incompatible, as anyone can see.	They been ful wrothe al day, as men may see.
Revelling and honesty, in one of low degree,	Revel and trouthe, as in a lowe degree,
For theft and debauchery, they are interchangeable.	For thefte and riot, they been convertible,
Even though he has no share of the entertainment (for which he pays).	Al have he no part of the mynstralcye.
His master shall pay for it in his shop,	His maister shal it in his shoppe abye,
Who makes a practice of dicing, debauchery, or womanizing,	That haunteth dys, riot, or paramour,
For surely (in the case of) an revelling apprentice	For sikerly a prentys revelour
For many times he found his cash box completely bare.	For often tyme he foond his box ful bare.
That found his master easily in his business accounts,	That fond his maister wel in his chaffare,
In his spending, in a private place.	Of his dispense, in place of pryvetee.
Than Perkin could, and thereto he was free	Than Perkyn koude, and therto he was free

And gathered him a company of his sort	And gadered hym a meynee of his sort
And danced well, he would not come back--	And daunced wel, he wolde nat come ayeyn --
Until that he had all the sight seen,	Til that he hadde al the sighte yseyn,
Out of the shop thither would he leap --	Out of the shoppe thider wolde he lepe --
For when there was any procession in Cheapside,	For whan ther any ridyng was in Chepe,
At every wedding party he would sing and dance;	At every bridale wolde he synge and hoppe;
Happy was the wench who with him might meet.	Wel was the wenche with hym myghte meete.

All naked, to fulfill their foul delight,	Al naked, to fulfille hir foul delit,
And bring them before them as an insult,	And bryngen hem biforn hem in despit,
They commanded (the guards) to seize his daughters	They comanded his doghtres for t' areste

Rather than do sin with her body?	Rather than with hir body doon trespas?
And many a maid, slain herself, alas,	And many a mayde, yslayn hirself, allas,
Has there not many a noble wife before this,	Hath ther nat many a noble wyf er this,
And with my death I may be free from blame, indeed.	And with my deth I may be quyt, ywis.
Or know myself false, or lose my good name;	Or knowe myselven fals, or lese my name;
My life than of my body to have a shame,	My lif than of my body to have a shame,
But neverthelees, yet I would rather lose	But nathelees, yet have I levere to lese
One of these two I am compelled to choose.	Oon of thise two bihoveth me to chese.
From which to escape I know no help,	Fro which t' escape woot I no socour,
That without warning hast wrapped me in thy chain,	That unwar wrapped hast me in thy cheyne,
"Alas," said she, "on thee, Fortune, I complain,	"Allas," quod she, "on thee, Fortune, I pleyne,
In her complaint, as you shall after hear:	In hire compleynt, as ye shal after heere:
With face pale and with full sorrowful manner,	With face pale and with ful sorweful cheere,
But to herself she spoke, and said thus,	But to hirself she spak, and seyde thus,
For Arveragus had gone out of town.	For out of towne was goon Arveragus.
But why it was she told to no person,	But why it was to no wight tolde shee,
And swoons, that it was pitiful to see.	And swowneth, that it routhe was to see.
For sheer fear she can hardly walk.	For verray feere unnethe may she go.
And home she goes a sorrowful creature;	And hoom she goth a sorweful creature;
It is against the laws of nature."	It is agayns the proces of nature."
That such a wonder or marvel could be!	That swich a monstre or merveille myghte be!
For I never supposed by possibility	For wende I nevere by possibilitee
"Alas," she said, "that ever this should happen!	"Allas," quod she, "that evere this sholde happe!

Do as you please; have your promise in mind,	Dooth as yow list; have youre biheste in mynde,
And if you agree, you may go see.	And if ye vouche sauf, ye may go see.

More than to save my heart's life right now --	Moore than to save myn hertes lyf right now --
Madam, I speak it for your honor	Madame, I speke it for the honour of yow
Although I am unworthy of it.	Al be that I unworthy am therto.
To love me best -- God knows, you said so,	To love me best -- God woot, ye seyde so,
You know right well what you promised me;	Ye woot right wel what ye bihighten me;
But in a garden yonder, at a particular place,	But in a gardyn yond, at swich a place,
From you, my sovereign lady, except for your good favor --	Of yow, my sovereyn lady, but youre grace --
Not that I claim any thing as a right	Nat that I chalange any thyng of right
For, madam, you know well what you have promised --	For, madame, wel ye woot what ye han hight --
Before you slay me because I love you.	Er ye me sleen by cause that I yow love.

Has saluted his sovereign lady dear:	Salewed hath his sovereyn lady deere:
With fearful heart and with full humble manner,	With dredful herte and with ful humble cheere,
Where he knew he should see his lady.	Where as he knew he sholde his lady see.
And to the temple he has held forth his way,	And to the temple his wey forth hath he holde,
Who have helped me out of my deadly cares."	That me han holpen fro my cares colde."

And said, "I woeful wretched, Aurelius,	And seyde, "I woful wrecche, Aurelius,
Down to his mistress' feet he fell at once,	Doun to his maistres feet he fil anon,
That every one of these rocks were removed,	That voyded were thise rokkes everychon,
And when he knew that there was no obstacle,	And whan he knew that ther was noon obstacle,
Waits night and day for this miracle;	Awaiteth nyght and day on this myracle;
Aurelius, who is yet in despair	Aurelius, which that yet despeired is
It seemed that all the rocks were away.	It semed that alle the rokkes were aweye.
But through his magic, for a week or two,	But thurgh his magik, for a wyke or tweye,
For which no longer he made delay,	For which no lenger maked he delayes,
As heathen folk used in those days.	As hethen folk useden in thilke dayes.
For such illusions and such evil practices	For swiche illusiouns and swiche meschaunces
And knew also his other observations	And knew also his othere observaunces
In accordance with his operation,	Acordaunt to his operacioun,
And knew full well the moon's position	And knew ful weel the moones mansioun
And knew the arising of his moon well,	And knew the arisyng of his moone weel,
He knew the remnant by astronomical tables,	He knew the remenaunt by proporcioun,
When he had found his first position of the moon,	Whan he hadde founde his firste mansioun,
Full subtly he calculated all this.	Ful subtilly he kalkuled al this.
That in the ninth sphere is observed;	That in the ninthe speere considered is;
From the head of that fixed Aries above,	Fro the heed of thilke fixe Aries above,
He knew full well how far the star Alnath was shoved	He knew ful wel how fer Alnath was shove
And by his eighth sphere in his working	And by his eighte speere in his wirkyng
For his divisions of the sphere in every detail.	For his equacions in every thyng.
Such as are his table of distances and his angles for calculation	As been his centris and his argumentz
Nor his dates for calculations, nor his other apparatus,	Ne his rootes, ne his othere geeris,
Neither his tables of single years nor of twenty-year periods,	Neither his collect ne his expans yeeris,
Accurately corrected, nor was there anything lacking,	Ful wel corrected, ne ther lakked nought,
His astronomical tables of Toledo he brought forth,	His tables Tolletanes forth he brought,
Of such a superstitious cursedness.	Of swich a supersticious cursednesse.

By such an appearance or conjurer's trick --	By swich an apparence or jogelrye --
This is to say, to make illusion,	This is to seye, to maken illusioun,
To seek a time for his astronomical operation;	To wayten a tyme of his conclusioun;
That night and day he worked as fast as he can	That nyght and day he spedde hym that he kan
This subtle clerk had such pity for this man	This subtil clerk swich routhe had of this man
Or with a sword he would slit his heart.	Or with a swerd that he wolde slitte his herte.
To bring him out of his bitter pains,	To bryngen hym out of his peynes smerte,
Provides for this master entertainment and reverence,	Dooth to this maister chiere and reverence,

Before him stands meat of the tusked boar,	Biforn hym stant brawen of the tusked swyn,
And drinks the wine from his buffalo horn;	And drynketh of his bugle horn the wyn;

Have destroyed the green in every garden.	Destroyed hath the grene in every yerd.
The bitter frosts, with the sleet and rain,	The bittre frostes, with the sleet and reyn,
Where he shone full pale, I dare well say.	Where as he shoon ful pale, I dar wel seyn.
Shone like burnished gold with bright rays;	Shoon as the burned gold with stremes brighte;

Phoebus grew old, and colored grayish silver,	Phebus wax old, and hewed lyk laton,
The cold, frosty season of December.	The colde, frosty seson of Decembre.
And this was, as these books remind me,	And this was, as thise bookes me remembre,
And are arrived where they would stay.	And been descended ther they wolde abyde.
Aurelius and this magician beside him,	Aurelius and this magicien bisyde,
To Brittany took they the direct route,	To Britaigne tooke they the righte way,
Upon the morrow, when it was day,	Upon the morwe, whan that it was day,
What for his labor and his hope of bliss,	What for his labour and his hope of blisse,
And well nigh all that night he had his rest.	And wel ny al that nyght he hadde his reste.
To bed is gone Aurelius when it pleased him,	To bedde is goon Aurelius whan hym leste,
"Nay," said this clerk, "have here my faith as a pledge."	"Nay," quod this clerk, "have heer my feith to borwe."
You delay us here any longer than to-morrow."	Ye tarie us heere no lenger than to-morwe."
But look now, for no negligence or laziness	But looketh now, for no necligence or slouthe
You shall be paid truly, by my pledged word!	Ye shal be payed trewely, by my trouthe!
This bargain is fully concluded, for we are agreed.	This bargayn is ful dryve, for we been knyt.
I would give it, if I were lord of it.	I wolde it yeve, if I were lord of it.
Answered thus: "Fie on a thousand pounds!	Answerde thus: "Fy on a thousand pound!
Aurelius, with blissful heart, at once	Aurelius, with blisful herte anoon,
Nor would he go gladly even for that sum.	Ne gladly for that somme he wolde nat goon.
Less than a thousand pounds he would not have,	Lasse than a thousand pound he wolde nat have,
He raised difficulties, and swore, as God may him save,	He made it straunge, and swoor, so God hym save,
And also from Gironde to the mouth of Seine.	And eek from Gerounde to the mouth of Sayne.
To remove all the rocks of Brittany,	To remoeven alle the rokkes of Britayne,
What sum this master's payment should be	What somme sholde this maistres gerdon be
At after-supper they began to discuss	At after-soper fille they in tretee
"Go we then to sup," said he, "as is the best (to do).	"Go we thanne soupe," quod he, "as for the beste.
It is all ready, even if you want it right now."	It is al redy, though ye wol right now."
"Sir," said this squire, "when it pleases you,	"Sire," quod this squier, "whan it liketh yow,
Into my study, where my books are."	Into my studie, ther as my bookes be."
When these worthy men went with me	Whan that thise worthy men wenten with me
Since I ordered you to make our supper,	Sith I yow bad oure soper for to make,
Almost an hour it is, I declare,	Almoost an houre it is, I undertake,
And said to him thus: "Is our supper ready?	And seyde hym thus: "Is redy oure soper?
This master called his squire to him,	To hym this maister called his squier,
But in his study, where his books are,	But in his studie, ther as his bookes be,
While they saw all this marvelous sight,	Whil they saugh al this sighte merveillous,
And yet moved they never out of the house,	And yet remoeved they nevere out of the hous,
And farewell! All our revel was gone.	And farewel! Al oure revel was ago.
Saw it was time, he clapped his two hands,	Saugh it was tyme, he clapte his handes two,
And when this master that wrought this magic	And whan this maister that this magyk wroughte
In which he himself danced, as he thought.	On which hymself he daunced, as hym thoughte.
That he showed him his lady in a dance,	That he hym shewed his lady on a daunce,
And after this he provided him such pleasure	And after this he dide hym swich plesaunce
That with their hawks have slain the heron.	That with hir haukes han the heron slayn.
These hunters with falcons upon a fair riverbank,	Thise fauconers upon a fair ryver,
He saw, when these wild deer were removed,	He saugh, whan voyded were thise wilde deer,
And some bled because of bitter wounds from arrows.	And somme with arwes blede of bittre woundes.
He saw a hundred of them slain by hounds,	He saugh of hem an hondred slayn with houndes,
The greatest that ever were seen with eye.	The gretteste that evere were seyn with ye.
There he saw harts with their high horns,	Ther saugh he hertes with hir hornes hye,
Forests, parks full of wild deer;	Forestes, parkes ful of wilde deer;
He showed him, before he went to supper,	He shewed hym, er he wente to sopeer,
So well appointed a house as this one was	So wel arrayed hous as ther was oon
They lacked no foods that might please them.	Hem lakked no vitaille that myghte hem plese.
Home to his house, and put them well at ease.	Hoom to his hous, and maden hem wel at ese.
And with this magician forth he is gone	And with this magicien forth is he gon
Down off his horse Aurelius alighted straightway,	Doun of his hors Aurelius lighte anon,
For which he wept very often many a tear.	For which he weep ful ofte many a teere.
And he answered him that they were dead,	And he answerde hym that they dede were,
Whom he had known in old days,	The whiche that he had knowe in olde dawes,
This Breton clerk asked him about fellows	This Briton clerk hym asked of felawes
And before they went any foot farther,	And er they ferther any foote wente,
"I know," he said, "the cause of your coming."	"I knowe," quod he, "the cause of youre comyng."
And after that he said a wonderful thing:	And after that he seyde a wonder thyng:
Who in Latin politely greeted them,	Which that in Latyn thriftily hem grette,
A young clerk roaming by himself they met,	A yong clerk romynge by hymself they mette,
Not more than two or three furlongs,	But if it were a two furlong or thre,
When they had come almost to that city,	Whan they were come almoost to that citee,
In hope to be relieved of his care.	In hope for to been lissed of his care.
And on his way forth then is he gone	And on his wey forthward thanne is he fare
And such encouragement he gave him to go	And swich confort he yaf hym for to gon
Unto his brother's bed he is come,	Unto his brotheres bed he comen is,
Why should I make a longer tale of this?	What sholde I make a lenger tale of this?
Or else he shall shame her at the least."	Or elles he shal shame hire atte leeste."
Then must she by necessity keep her promise,	Thanne moste she nedes holden hire biheste,
Then my brother would be cured of his woe;	Thanne were my brother warisshed of his wo;
And in such form endure a week or two.	And in swich forme enduren a wowke or two.
And ships by the shore come and go,	And shippes by the brynke comen and gon,
Of Brittany were removed every one,	Of Britaigne weren yvoyded everichon,
For with an apparition a clerk may make it seem,	For with an apparence a clerk may make,
He should well make my brother have his love.	He sholde wel make my brother han his love.
Or other natural science beyond that	Or oother magyk natureel above,
Who had these moon's stations in mind,	That hadde thise moones mansions in mynde,
At Orleans find some old fellow	At Orliens som oold felawe yfynde
"Now then conclude I thus: that if I might	"Now thanne conclude I thus: that if I myghte
Thus it seemed to every man's sight.	Thus semed it to every mannes sighte.
And when they pleased, they made it suddenly disappear.	And whan hem lyked, voyded it anon.
Sometimes a castle, all of mortar and stone;	Somtyme a castel, al of lym and stoon;
And sometimes flowers spring as in a field;	And somtyme floures sprynge as in a mede;
Sometimes a grim lion has seemed to come;	Somtyme hath semed come a grym leoun;
And in the hall row up and down.	And in the halle rowen up and doun.
Have made come in a water and a barge,	Have maad come in a water and a barge,
That illusionists within a large hall	That tregetours withinne an halle large
For often at feasts have I well heard say	For ofte at feestes have I wel herd seye
Such as these subtle illusionists play.	Swiche as thise subtile tregetoures pleye.
By which men make diverse illusions,	By whiche men make diverse apparences,
For I am sure that there are sciences	For I am siker that ther be sciences
And to himself he said secretly,	And to hymself he seyde pryvely:
Straightway for joy his heart began to dance,	Anon for joye his herte gan to daunce,
And when this book was in his remembrance,	And whan this book was in his remembraunce,
Does not allow any illusion to grieve us.	Ne suffreth noon illusioun us to greve.
For holy church's faith in our belief	For hooly chirches feith in oure bileve
As in our days is not worth a fly --	As in oure dayes is nat worth a flye --
That belong to the moon, and such folly	That longen to the moone, and swich folye
Concerning the eight and twenty stations	Touchynge the eighte and twenty mansiouns
Which book spoke much of the operations	Which book spak muchel of the operaciouns
Although he was there to learn another craft,	Al were he ther to lerne another craft,
Who was at that time a bachelor of law,	That was that tyme a bacheler of lawe,
Of natural science, which his fellow,	Of magyk natureel, which his felawe,
At Orleans in a study hall he saw a book	At Orliens in studie a book he say
He remembered that, one day,	He hym remembred that, upon a day,
To learn specialized branches of learning --	Particuler sciences for to lerne --
Seek in every nook and every cranny	Seken in every halke and every herne
To read arts that are arcane	To reden artes that been curious
As young clerks that are eager	As yonge clerkes that been lykerous
Until at the last he remembered,	Til atte laste hym fil in remembraunce,
His brother wept and wailed secretly,	His brother weep and wayled pryvely,
Unless one could touch the arrow or grasp it.	But men myghte touche the arwe or come therby.
In surgery the treatment is perilous,	In surgerye is perilous the cure,
And well you know that for a wound healed only on the surface	And wel ye knowe that of a sursanure
But in his heart ever was the sharp arrow.	But in his herte ay was the arwe kene.
His breast was unhurt, in outward appearance,	His brest was hool, withoute for to sene,
Than ever did Pamphilus for Galathee.	Than evere dide Pamphilus for Galathee.
Under his breast he bore it more secretly	Under his brest he baar it moore secree
For to no other creature, certainly,	For to noon oother creature, certeyn,
He knew of all this woe and all this suffering,	He knew of al this wo and al this werk,
Except from his brother, who was a clerk.	Save of his brother, which that was a clerk.
Nor had he any comfort in this time,	Ne confort in this tyme hadde he noon,
Before he could set a foot on the ground;	Er any foot he myghte on erthe gon;
Two years and more lay wretched Aurelius,	Two yeer and moore lay wrecche Aurelyus,
In suffering and in hellish torment	In langour and in torment furyus
And of the sick Aurelius I will tell.	And of the sike Aurelius wol I telle.
And thus in joy and bliss I let them dwell,	And thus in joye and blisse I lete hem dwelle,
He pays no attention to any such matter,	He noght entendeth to no swich mateere,
To her of love; he had of it no fear.	To hire of love; he hadde of it no doute.
If any person had spoken, while he was away,	If any wight hadde spoke, whil he was oute,
He not at all desired to be suspicious,	No thyng list hym to been ymaginatyf,
That loves thee as his own heart's life.	That loveth thee as his owene hertes lyf.
The vigorous knight, the worthy man of arms,	The fresshe knyght, the worthy man of armes,
That hast thy lusty husband in thine arms,	That hast thy lusty housbonde in thyne armes,
O blissful art thou now, thou Dorigen,	O blisful artow now, thou Dorigen,
Is come home, and other worthy men.	Is comen hoom, and othere worthy men.
Arveragus, with well-being and great honor,	Arveragus, with heele and greet honour,
Let him choose, for all I care, whether he will live or die.	Chese he, for me, wheither he wol lyve or dye.
I leave this woeful creature lying;	Lete I this woful creature lye;
Despaired in this torment and this thought	Dispeyred in this torment and this thoght
Caught him up and to bed he has him brought.	Up caughte hym and to bedde he hath hym broght.
His brother, who knew of his suffering,	His brother, which that knew of his penaunce,
And for a long time he lay in a trance.	And longe tyme he lay forth in a traunce.
And with that word he fell down in a faint,	And with that word in swowne he fil adoun,
And on my pain have some compassion."	And of my peyne have som compassioun."
Thy temple in Delphi I will barefoot seek.	Thy temple in Delphos wol I barefoot seke.
Or never more shall I win my lady.	Or nevere mo shal I my lady wynne.
Under the ground, in which Pluto dwells,	Under the ground, ther Pluto dwelleth inne,
Into her own dark region	Into hir owene dirke regioun
Pray her to sink every rock down	Prey hire to synken every rok adoun
To grant me my sovereign lady dear,	To graunte me my sovereyn lady deere,
And unless she agree in such manner	And but she vouche sauf in swich manere
And spring flood will last both night and day.	And spryng flood laste bothe nyght and day.
Then shall she be fully even with you always,	Thanne shal she been evene atte fulle alway,

Pray her that she go at no faster speed as you;	Preye hire she go no faster cours than ye;
"Lord Phoebus, do this miracle for me.	"Lord Phebus, dooth this miracle for me.
`Keep your promise, the rocks are away.'	`Holdeth youre heste, the rokkes been aweye.'
Then certainly to my lady may I say,	Thanne certes to my lady may I seye,
And let this flood-tide endure for two years.	And lat this flood endure yeres tweyne.
The highest rock in Armorican Brittany;	The hyeste rokke in Armorik Briteyne;
That five fathoms at the least it rise above	That fyve fadme at the leeste it oversprynge
Pray her so great a high tide to bring	As preieth hire so greet a flood to brynge
That now at this next opposition (of the sun and moon)	That now next at this opposicion
Do this miracle, or make my heart break --	Do this miracle, or do myn herte breste --
Wherefore, lord Phoebus, this is my request --	Wherfore, lord Phebus, this is my requeste --
Both in the sea and rivers great and small.	Bothe in the see and ryveres moore and lesse.
To follow her, as she that is goddess	To folwen hire, as she that is goddesse
Just so the sea desires naturally	Right so the see desireth naturelly
For which she follows you very attentively,	For which she folweth yow ful bisily,
Is to be kindled and ignited by your fire,	Is to be quyked and lighted of youre fir,
You know well, lord, that just as her desire	Ye knowen wel, lord, that right as hir desir
(Though Neptune have godly dominion in the sea,	(Though Neptunus have deitee in the see,
Who of the sea is chief goddess and queen	That of the see is chief goddesse and queene
"Your blissful sister, Lucina the bright,	"Youre blisful suster, Lucina the sheene,
How I may be helped and in what manner.	How that I may been holpen and in what wyse.
Now grant that I may tell you	Now voucheth sauf that I may yow devyse
You can help me best (of anyone), except for my lady.	Ye may me helpen, save my lady, best.
For well I know, lord Phoebus, if you wish,	For wel I woot, lord Phebus, if yow lest,
Upon my dying heart have some pity.	Upon my dedly herte have som pitee.
Without guilt, unless thy kindness	Withoute gilt, but thy benignytee
On wretched Aurelius, who is as good as lost.	On wrecche Aurelie, which that am but lorn.
Lord Phoebus, cast thy merciful eye	Lord Phebus, cast thy merciable eighe
As thy astronomical position changes low or high,	As thyn herberwe chaungeth lowe or heighe,
To each of them its time and its season,	To ech of hem his tyme and his seson,
That gives, according to thy height (in the sky),	That yevest, after thy declinacion,
Of every plant, herb, tree, and flower,	Of every plaunte, herbe, tree, and flour,
He said, "Apollo, god and governor	He seyde, "Appollo, god and governour
Unto the gods, and first unto the sun:	Unto the goddes, and first unto the sonne:
With piteous heart he has begun his complaint	With pitous herte his pleynt hath he bigonne
For utter woe out of his wits he suddenly went.	For verray wo out of his wit he breyde.
And in his delirium said his prayer.	And in his ravyng seyde his orisoun.
And on his bare knees he set himself down,	And on his knowes bare he sette hym doun,
Up to the heaven his hands he did hold,	Up to the hevene his handes he gan holde,
He thought that he felt his heart grow cold.	Hym semed that he felte his herte colde.
He sees he can not escape from his death;	He seeth he may nat fro his deeth asterte;
He to his house is gone with sorrowful heart.	He to his hous is goon with sorweful herte.
Save only wretched Aurelius, alas!	Save oonly wrecche Aurelius, allas!
And home they go in joy and in pleasure,	And hoom they goon in joye and in solas,
For the horizon has bereft the sun of its light --	For th' orisonte hath reft the sonne his lyght --
Until the bright sun lost its hue;	Til that the brighte sonne loste his hewe;
But suddenly began to revel anew	But sodeynly bigonne revel newe
And knew nothing of this business,	And nothyng wiste of this conclusioun,
And in the garden paths roamed up and down,	And in the aleyes romeden up and doun,
Then came her other friends many a one,	Tho coome hir othere freendes many oon,
And with that word he turned away immediately.	And with that word he turned hym anon.
Then I must die of sudden horrible death."	Thanne moot I dye of sodeyn deth horrible."
"Madame," he said, "this would be an impossiblity!	"Madame," quod he, "this were an inpossible!
Woe was Aurelius when he heard this,	Wo was Aurelie whan that he this herde,
Aurelius very often bitterly sighs;	Aurelius ful ofte soore siketh;
Who has her body whenever he pleases?"	That hath hir body whan so that hym liketh?"
To go love another man's wife,	For to go love another mannes wyf,
What pleasure should a man have in his life	What deyntee sholde a man han in his lyf

Of rocks that there is no stone seen,	Of rokkes that ther nys no stoon ysene,
I say, when you have made the coast so clean	I seye, whan ye han maad the coost so clene
So that they do not prevent ship nor boat to go --	That they ne lette ship ne boot to goon --

On whatever day that from end to end of Brittany	Looke what day that endelong Britayne
Since I see you so piteously lament.	Syn I yow se so pitously complayne.
Yet would I grant you to be your love,	Yet wolde I graunte yow to been youre love,

Never before," she said, "Did I know what you meant.	Nevere erst," quod she, "ne wiste I what ye mente.
"Is this your desire," said she, "and say you thus?	"Is this youre wyl," quod she, "and sey ye thus?

Here at your feet would God that I were buried!	Heere at youre feet God wolde that I were grave!
For with one word you may me slay or save.	For with a word ye may me sleen or save.
Madame, have pity upon my bitter pains;	Madame, reweth upon my peynes smerte;
My reward is but the breaking of my heart.	My gerdon is but brestyng of myn herte.
For well I know my service is in vain;	For wel I woot my servyce is in vayn;
Had went from where I should never have come back.	Hadde went ther nevere I sholde have come agayn.
Went over the sea, that I, Aurelius,	Wente over the see, that I, Aurelius,

And (she) had known him for a long time,	And hadde yknowen hym of tyme yoore,
And was a man of good reputation and honor,	And was a man of worshipe and honour,
Because he was her neighbor,	By cause that he was hire neighebour,
Nonetheless it happened, before they went away,	Nathelees it happed, er they thennes wente,

Except that, by chance, sometimes at dances,	Save that, paraventure, somtyme at daunces,
He dared not reveal to her his woe,	Ne dorste he nat to hire his wo biwreye,
In other ways than you hear me say,	In oother manere than ye heere me seye,
For Narcissus, she who dared not tell her woe.	For Narcisus, that dorste nat telle hir wo.
And he must die, he said, as did Echo	And dye he moste, he seyde, as dide Ekko
But suffers as a fury does in hell;	But langwissheth as a furye dooth in helle;

Of such subject matter made he many lays,	Of swich matere made he manye layes,
He said he loved and was in no way loved in return	He seyde he lovede and was biloved no thyng.
His woe, as in a general lament;	His wo, as in a general compleynyng;
Except in his songs somewhat he would reveal	Save in his songes somwhat wolde he wreye
He was in despair; he dared say nothing,	He was despeyred; no thyng dorste he seye,
Copiously he drank all his penance (suffered intensely).	Withouten coppe he drank al his penaunce.
But he never dared tell her his grievance.	But nevere dorste he tellen hire his grevaunce.

In this dance, among other men,	Upon this daunce, amonges othere men,
And with good hope let her sorrow slip away.	And with good hope lete hir sorwe slyde.
But nonetheless she must a time abide	But nathelees she moste a tyme abyde
Who was her husband and her love also.	That was hir housbonde and hir love also.
For she did not see him on the dance go	For she ne saugh hym on the daunce go
Who made always her complaint and her moan,	Which made alwey hir compleint and hir moone,
And sing also, save Dorigen alone,	And synge also, save Dorigen allone,

In which they had made their arrangement	In which that they hadde maad hir ordinaunce
Unto a garden that was there nearby,	Unto a gardyn that was ther bisyde,
So on a day, early in the morning-tide,	So on a day, right in the morwe-tyde,
They dance and they play at chess and backgammon.	They dauncen and they pleyen at ches and tables.
And also in other delightful places;	And eek in othere places delitables;

What I acquire is the total of all my income.	My purchas is th'effect of al my rente.
To know whether men will give me any thing.	To wite wher men wol yeve me any thyng.
And here I ride about on my acquisition of profits,	And heere I ryde aboute my purchasyng,

No sort of pangs of conscience for that have I.	No maner conscience of that have I.
Unless it be too heavy or too hot.	But if it be to hevy or to hoot.

And it happened that he saw before him ride	And happed that he saugh bifore hym ryde
Pretending to have a case against her, for he wanted a bribe.	Feynynge a cause, for he wolde brybe.

Therefore on it he set all his intention.	Therfore on it he sette al his entente.
And because that was the best part of all his income,	And for that was the fruyt of al his rente,
Or an adulterer, or a concubine.	Or an avowtier, or a paramour.
Better than this summoner knew a sly lecher,	Bet than this somnour knew a sly lecchour,

And was a thief, exactly such a thief was he;	And was a theef, right swich a theef was he;
And just as Judas had small amounts of the apostles' money,	And right as Judas hadde purses smale,
And make him great feasts at the ale-house.	And make hym grete feestes atte nale.
And they were glad to fill his purse	And they were glade for to fille his purs
Without an actual summons an ignorant man	Withouten mandement a lewed man
His master knew not always what he earned.	His maister knew nat alwey what he wan.
He got himself a great profit in this way;	He took hymself a greet profit therby;
They were secretly his agents.	They weren his approwours prively.
For their acquaintance was not come recently.	For hire acqueyntance was nat come of newe.
Who told him all the secrets that they knew,	That tolde hym al the secree that they knewe,

For we are exempt from his authority.	For we are out of his correccioun.
To tell his wickedness I will not desist;	To telle his harlotrye I wol nat spare;
To direct him to four and twenty more.	To techen hym to foure and twenty mo.
He could spare one or two of the lechers,	He koude spare of lecchours oon or two,
That showed him well where there might be profit for him.	That taughte hym wel wher that hym myghte availle.
For deviously he had his network of spies,	For subtilly he hadde his espiaille,
No one in England was a more clever rascal;	A slyer boye nas noon in Engelond;

Power to have them punished.	Power to doon on hem correccioun.

For small tithes and for small offering	For smale tithes and for smal offrynge
There could escape him no monetary punishment (fine).	Ther myghte asterte hym no pecunyal peyne.
If any parson would complain about them.	If any persoun wolde upon hem pleyne.
And those who paid less than full tithes were severely punished,	And smale tytheres weren foule yshent,
They had to sing out in pain if they were taken;	They sholde syngen if that they were hent;
But certainly, to lechers did he the greatest woe;	But certes, lecchours dide he grettest wo;
Of usury, and of simony also.	Of usure, and of symonye also.
Of marriage contracts and of failure to take the sacraments,	Of contractes and of lakke of sacramentz,
Of defamation of character, and adultery,	Of diffamacioun, and avowtrye,
Of witchcraft, and also of pandering,	Of wicchecraft, and eek of bawderye,
In punishment of fornication,	In punysshynge of fornicacioun,

"Tell forth your tale, beloved master dear."	"Tel forth youre tale, leeve maister deere."
And after this he said unto the Friar,	And after this he seyde unto the Frere,
And how he does his job I shall tell him, indeed."	And his office I shal hym telle, ywis."

Tell your tale, and leave the Summoner alone."	Telleth youre tale, and lat the Somonour be."

And is beaten (and driven away) at every town's end."	And is ybet at every townes ende."
With summonses for fornication,	With mandementz for fornicacioun,
A summoner is a runner up and down	A somonour is a rennere up and doun
I pray that none of you be displeased.	I praye that noon of you be yvele apayd.
That no good may be said of a summoner;	That of a somonour may no good be sayd;
By God, you can easily tell by the name	Pardee, ye may wel knowe by the name
I will tell you an amusing tale about a summoner.	I wol yow of a somonour telle a game.

And with that word we rode forth on our way,	And with that word we ryden forth oure weye,
Now let us ride, and listen to what I say."	Now lat us ryde, and herkneth what I seye."
What! Welcome be the draw, in God's name!	What, welcome be the cut, a Goddes name!
To keep his agreement by his free assent,	To kepe his foreward by his free assent,
Like one who was wise and obedient	As he that wys was and obedient
And when this good man saw that it was so,	And whan this goode man saugh that it was so,
As you have heard; what more words are needed?	As ye han herd; what nedeth wordes mo?
By our previous promise and by formal agreement,	By foreward and by composicioun,
And he must tell his tale, as was reasonable,	And telle he moste his tale, as was resoun,

Well ornamented and sharp as the point of a spear;	Harneised wel and sharp as point of spere;
And on that other side an elegant dagger	And on that oother syde a gay daggere

A sheaf of peacock arrows, bright and keen,	A sheef of pecok arwes, bright and kene,
And he (the yeoman) was clad in coat and hood of green.	And he was clad in cote and hood of grene.
At that time, for it pleased him so to travel,	At that tyme, for hym liste ride so,
He (the Knight) had A YEOMAN and no more servants	A YEMAN hadde he and servantz namo
And carved before his father at the table.	And carf biforn his fader at the table.
Courteous he was, humble, and willing to serve,	Curteis he was, lowely, and servysable,

Singing he was, or fluting, all the day;	Syngynge he was, or floytynge, al the day;
All full of fresh flowers, white and red.	Al ful of fresshe floures, whyte and reede.

In hope to stand in his lady's good graces.	In hope to stonden in his lady grace.
And conducted himself well, for so little a space of time,	And born hym weel, as of so litel space,

With him there was his son, a young SQUIRE,	With hym ther was his sone, a yong SQUIER,
And went to do his pilgrimage.	And wente for to doon his pilgrymage.
For he was recently come (back) from his expedition,	For he was late ycome from his viage,
All stained (with rust) by his coat of mail,	Al bismotered with his habergeon,
His horses were good, but he was not gaily dressed.	His hors were goode, but he was nat gay.
But to tell you of his clothing,	But for to tellen yow of his array,
He was a truly perfect, noble knight.	He was a verray, parfit gentil knyght.

And evermore he had an outstanding reputation	And everemoore he hadde a sovereyn prys.
Against another heathen in Turkey;	Agayn another hethen in Turkye;

And for that he had ridden, no man farther,	And therto hadde he riden, no man ferre,
He was very worthy in his lord's war,	Ful worthy was he in his lordes werre,

And in brief, when the sun was (gone) to rest,	And shortly, whan the sonne was to reste,
And we were well accommodated in the best way.	And wel we weren esed atte beste.

His lament, and for love his hot fires,	His compleynte, and for love his hoote fires,
Where he had his amorous desires,	Ther as he hadde his amorouse desires,
That in that same grove, sweet-smelling and green,	That in that selve grove, swoote and grene,
Had the battle between them for love,	Hadden for love the bataille hem bitwene,
That there where first Arcite and Palamon	That ther as first Arcite and Palamoun
And at the last he concluded	And at the laste he took conclusioun
And also most honorable in (regard to) his rank.	And eek moost honurable in his degree.
Of good Arcite may best be made,	Of goode Arcite may best ymaked be,
Considered now where the tomb	Caste now wher that the sepulture
The people that they should comfort themselves.	The peple that they sholde hem reconforte.
To this effect, full wisely to exhort	To this effect, ful wisely to enhorte
And beyond all this yet he said much more	And over al this yet seyde he muchel moore
Death is an end of every worldly pain."	Deeth is an ende of every worldly soore."
And we are pilgrims, passing to and fro.	And we been pilgrymes, passynge to and fro.
This world is nothing but a thoroughfare full of woe,	This world nys but a thurghfare ful of wo,
"In all this world, who some time did not die.	"In al this world, that som tyme he ne deyde.
Just so there lived never a man," he said,	Right so ther lyvede never man," he seyde,
"Who did not live in earth to some extent	"That he ne lyvede in erthe in some degree,
And showed them examples and comparisons.	And shewed hem ensamples and liknesse.
Joy after woe, and woe after gladness,	Joye after wo, and wo after gladnesse,
As he had seen it change both up and down,	As he hadde seyn it chaunge bothe up and doun,
Who knew the changes of this world,	That knew this worldes transmutacioun,
Except for his old father Egeus,	Savynge his olde fader Egeus,
No man might comfort Theseus,	No man myghte gladen Theseus,
"Since thou haddest gold enough, and Emelye?"	"And haddest gold ynough, and Emelye?"
"Why wouldst thou be dead," these women cry,	"Why woldestow be deed," thise wommen crye,
Scratching of cheeks, also tearing of hair.	Cracchynge of chekes, rentynge eek of heer.
When Hector was brought, just recently slain,	Whan Ector was ybroght, al fressh yslayn,
There was no such great weeping, certainly,	So greet wepyng was ther noon, certayn,
For him there weep both child and man;	For hym ther wepeth bothe child and man;
In all the town for the death of this Theban.	In al the toun for deeth of this Theban.
Of old folk and folk of tender years	Of olde folk and folk of tendre yeeres
Infinite are the sorrows and the tears	Infinite been the sorwes and the teeres
That at the last certainly they die.	That at the laste certeinly they dye.
Or else fall in such illness	Or ellis fallen in swich maladye
That for the most part they so sorrow,	That for the moore part they sorwen so,
For in such cases women have such sorrow,	For in swich cas wommen have swich sorwe,
To tell how she wept both evening and morning?	To tellen how she weep bothe eve and morwe?
What helps it to waste the whole day	What helpeth it to tarien forth the day
Swooning, and carried her away from the corpse.	Swownynge, and baar hire fro the corps away.
And Theseus immediately took his sister	And Theseus his suster took anon
Emelye shrieked, and Palamon howls,	Shrighte Emelye, and howleth Palamon,
Now will I speak forth of Emelye.	Now wol I speken forth of Emelye.
Arcite is cold, may Mars guide his soul!	Arcite is coold, ther Mars his soule gye!
Of them, though they write of where they (the souls) dwell.	Of hem, though that they writen wher they dwelle.
I find nothing about souls in this register,	Of soules fynde I nat in this registre,
Therefore I stop; I am no theologian;	Therfore I stynte; I nam no divinistre;
Since I came never (there), I can not tell where.	As I cam nevere, I kan nat tellen wher.
His spirit changed house and went where,	His spirit chaunged hous and wente ther,
His last word was, "Mercy, Emelye!"	His laste word was, "Mercy, Emelye!"
But on his lady yet he cast his eye;	But on his lady yet caste he his ye;
His two eyes grew dark, and his breath failed,	Dusked his eyen two, and failled breeth,
Began to fail when the heart felt death.	Gan faillen whan the herte felte deeth.
That dwelled in his heart sick and sore,	That dwelled in his herte syk and soore,
The vital strength is lost and all gone.	The vital strengthe is lost and al ago.
And yet moreover, for in his two arms	And yet mooreover, for in his armes two
The cold of death, which had overcome him,	The coold of deeth, that hadde hym overcome,
For from his feet up to his breast had come	For from his feet up to his brest was come
And with that word his speech began to fail,	And with that word his speche faille gan,
Forget not Palamon, the gentle man."	Foryet nat Palamon, the gentil man."
And if ever you shall be a wife,	And if that evere ye shul ben a wyf,
Who serves you, and will do so all his life.	That serveth yow, and wol doon al his lyf.
So worthy to be loved as Palamon,	So worthy to ben loved as Palamon,
As Jupiter may have concern for my soul,	So Juppiter have of my soule part,
Nobility of character, and all that belongs to that art --	Fredom, and al that longeth to that art --
Wisdom, humbleness, rank, and noble ancestry,	Wysdom, humblesse, estaat, and heigh kynrede,
That is to say, truth, honor, knighthood,	That is to seyen, trouthe, honour, knyghthede,
With all the attendant attributes truly --	With alle circumstances trewely --
To speak specifically of a servant (of love),	To speken of a servaunt proprely,
And as Jupiter may guide my soul,	And Juppiter so wys my soule gye,
For love of you, and for my jealousy.	For love of yow, and for my jalousye.
Had strife and rancor many a day ago	Had strif and rancour many a day agon
For love of God, and listen to what I say.	For love of God, and herkneth what I seye.
And softly take me in your two arms,	And softe taak me in youre armes tweye,
Fare well, my sweet foe, my Emelye!	Fare wel, my sweete foo, myn Emelye!
Alone, without any company.	Allone, withouten any compaignye.
Now with his love, now in his cold grave	Now with his love, now in his colde grave
What is this world? What do people ask to have?	What is this world? What asketh men to have?
My heart's lady, ender of my life!	Myn hertes lady, endere of my lyf!
Alas, my heart's queen! Alas, my wife,	Allas, myn hertes queene! Allas, my wyf,
Alas, separation of our company!	Allas, departynge of oure compaignye!
That I have suffered for you, and so long!	That I for yow have suffred, and so longe!
Alas, the woe! Alas, the strong pains,	Allas, the wo! Allas, the peynes stronge,
Since my life can no longer endure.	Syn that my lyf may no lenger dure.
To you above every creature,	To yow aboven every creature,
But I bequeath the service of my ghost	But I biquethe the servyce of my goost
To you, my lady, whom I love most,	To yow, my lady, that I love moost,
Declare one small part of all my painful sorrows	Declare o point of alle my sorwes smerte
"The woeful spirit in my heart can not	"Naught may the woful spirit in myn herte
Then said he thus, as you shall after hear:	Thanne seyde he thus, as ye shal after heere:
For which he sends after Emelye,	For which he sendeth after Emelye,
This is the whole of it, that Arcite must die;	This al and som, that Arcita moot dye;
Fare well medicine! Go bear the man to church!	Fare wel phisik! Go ber the man to chirche!
And certainly, where Nature will not work,	And certeinly, ther Nature wol nat wirche,
Nature now has no power to control.	Nature hath now no dominacioun.
All is shattered in that region;	Al is tobrosten thilke regioun;
Vomit upward, nor downward laxative.	Vomyt upward, ne dounward laxatif.
Avails him neither, to preserve his life,	Hym gayneth neither, for to gete his lif,
Is destroyed by poison and corrupted matter.	Is shent with venym and corrupcioun.
The pipes of his lungs began to swell,	The pipes of his longes gonne to swelle,
Can not remove nor expel the poison.	Ne may the venym voyden ne expelle.
From that power called natural	Fro thilke vertu cleped natural
The power expulsive (to expel fluids), or animal,	The vertu expulsif, or animal,
Nor drink of herbs can be any help to him.	Ne drynke of herbes may ben his helpynge.
That neither blood letting at a vein, nor applying suction cups,	That neither veyne-blood, ne ventusynge,
Corrupts, and is left in the trunk of his body,	Corrupteth, and is in his bouk ylaft,
The clotted blood, despite any medical treatment,	The clothered blood, for any lechecraft,
At his heart increases more and more.	Encreesseth at his herte moore and moore.
But speak of Palamon and of Arcite.	But speke of Palamon and of Arcite.
Of this battle I will write no more,	Of this bataille I wol namoore endite,
There was no more but "Fare well, have good day!"	Ther was namoore but "Fare wel, have good day!"
And home went every man the direct way.	And hoom wente every man the righte way.
Out of his town a full day's journey.	Out of his toun a journee largely.
And honorably escorted the kings	And conveyed the kynges worthily
And held a feast for fully three days,	And fully heeld a feeste dayes three,
And gave them gifts in accordance with their ranks,	And yaf hem yiftes after hir degree,
And either side equal as the other's brother;	And eyther syde ylik as ootheres brother;
To put a stop to all rancor and ill-will,	To stynten alle rancour and envye,
For which anon duke Theseus had proclaimed,	For which anon duc Theseus leet crye,
No man there may call it cowardice.	Ther may no man clepen it cowardye.
He incurred no shameful blame for it;	It nas arretted hym no vileynye;
By men on foot, both yeomen and also foot soldiers --	With footmen, bothe yemen and eek knaves --
And also his steed driven forth with staves	And eke his steede dryven forth with staves
And dragged forth by arm, foot, and toe,	And haryed forth by arme, foot, and too,
One person alone, without others,	O persone allone, withouten mo,
Without having surrendered, and taken by twenty knights,	Unyolden, and with twenty knyghtes take,
For falling is nothing but an accident,	For fallyng nys nat but an aventure,
For truly there was no defeat.	For soothly ther was no disconfiture.
But (only) as a joust or a tournament;	But as a justes or a tourneiynge;
Nor was it considered any defeat (in battle)	Ne ther was holden no disconfitynge
For the foreign lords, as was right.	Unto the straunge lordes, as was right.
And made revel all the long night	And made revel al the longe nyght
Comforts and honors every man,	Conforteth and honoureth every man,
For which this noble duke, as he well knows how,	For which this noble duc, as he wel kan,
They drank, for they wanted to have their limbs cured.	They dronken, for they wolde hir lymes have.
Some had salves, and some had charms;	Somme hadden salves, and somme hadden charmes;
To other wounds and to broken arms	To othere woundes and to broken armes
Whose breastbone was pierced by a spear.	That with a spere was thirled his brest boon.
Although they (were) sorely hurt, and especially one,	Al were they soore yhurt, and namely oon,
That of them all there was no one slain,	That of hem alle was ther noon yslayn,
And of another thing they were as happy,	And of another thyng they weren as fayn,
He shall be healed of his injuries.	He shal been heeled of his maladye.
People said also that Arcite shall not dye;	Men seyde eek that Arcite shal nat dye;
He would not distress them all.	He nolde noght disconforten hem alle.
With all bliss and great solemnity.	With alle blisse and greet solempnitee.
Is come home to Athens, his city,	Is comen hoom to Atthenes his citee,
Duke Theseus, with all his company,	Duc Theseus, with al his compaignye,
And always crying for Emelye.	And alwey criynge after Emelye.
For he was yet conscious and alive,	For he was yet in memorie and alyve,
And brought in a bed very gently and quickly,	And in a bed ybrought ful faire and blyve,
Then was he cut out of his armor	Tho was he korven out of his harneys
With painful heart, to Theseus's palace.	With herte soor, to Theseus paleys.
Immediately he was carried out of the place,	Anon he was yborn out of the place,
He lay as black as any coal or crow,	As blak he lay as any cole or crowe,
His breast shattered by his saddlebow.	His brest tobrosten with his sadel-bowe.
That in the place he lay as if he were dead,	That in the place he lay as he were deed,
He hit himself on the top of his head,	He pighte hym on the pomel of his heed,
And before Arcite can take heed,	And er that Arcite may taken keep,
And leaped aside, and stumbled as he leaped;	And leep aside, and foundred as he leep;
For which his horse for fear began to turn,	For which his hors for fere gan to turne,
Sent from Pluto at the request of Saturn,	From Pluto sent at requeste of Saturne,
Out of the ground leaped an infernal fury,	Out of the ground a furie infernal sterte,
They all follow the favor of Fortune)	Thei folwen alle the favour of Fortune)
(For women, so to speak in general,	(For wommen, as to speken in comune,
And she to him cast a friendly eye	And she agayn hym caste a freendlich ye
Looking upward upon this Emelye;	Lokynge upward upon this Emelye;
He spurs from one end to the other of the large open space	He priketh endelong the large place
And on a war horse, to show his face,	And on a courser, for to shewe his face,
This fierce Arcite has taken off his helm,	This fierse Arcite hath of his helm ydon,
(Hear) what a miracle at once befell there.	Which a myracle ther bifel anon.
But listen to me, and stop the noise for a little,	But herkneth me, and stynteth noyse a lite,
The heralds, who full loudly yell and cry,	The heraudes, that ful loude yelle and crie,
The trumpeters, with the loud music,	The trompours, with the loude mynstralcie,
And, by my head, thou shalt be relieved soon."	And, by myn heed, thow shalt been esed soone."
Mars has his will, his knight has all his request,	Mars hath his wille, his knyght hath al his boone,
Saturn said, "Daughter, hold thy peace!	Saturnus seyde, "Doghter, hoold thy pees!
She said, "I am disgraced, doubtless."	She seyde, "I am ashamed, doutelees."
Until her tears fell in the lists?	Til that hir teeres in the lystes fille?
But weeps so, for lack of (having) her will,	But wepeth so, for wantynge of hir wille,
What says she now? What does this queen of love,	What seith she now? What dooth this queene of love,
It seemed that the lists should fall.	It semed that the lystes sholde falle.
For joy of this, so loud and clamorous indeed	For joye of this, so loude and heighe withalle
Immediately there is a noise of people begun	Anon ther is a noyse of peple bigonne
Who by his fortune has won her fairly."	That by his fortune hath hire faire ywonne."
Arcite of Thebes shall have Emelye,	Arcite of Thebes shal have Emelie,
I will be true judge, and no partisan.	I wol be trewe juge, and no partie.
He cried, "Stop! no more, for it is done!	He cryde, "Hoo! namoore, for it is doon!
Unto each one of the folk that fought thus	Unto the folk that foghten thus echon
And when Theseus had seen this sight,	And whan that Theseus hadde seyn this sighte,
Who sorrows now but woeful Palamon,	Who sorweth now but woful Palamoun,
By force and also by the agreed terms of battle.	By force and eek by composicioun.
He must abide, when he was caught,	He moste abyde, whan that he was caught,
His hardy heart could not help him:	His hardy herte myghte hym helpe naught:
But all for naught; he was brought to the stake.	But al for noght; he was broght to the stake.
So hit him Palamon before he was taken.	So hitte him Palamoun er he were take.
Is carried out of his saddle a sword's length,	Is born out of his sadel a swerdes lengthe,
And king Emetreus, despite all his strength,	And kyng Emetreus, for al his strengthe,
The strong king Lygurge is born down,	The stronge kyng Lygurge is born adoun,
Without having surrendered, and dragged to the stake.	Unyolden, and ydrawen to the stake.
And by the force of twenty he (Palamon) is taken	And by the force of twenty is he take
And made his sword deep in his flesh to bite,	And made his swerd depe in his flessh to byte,
This Palamon, as he fought with Arcite,	This Palamon, as he faught with Arcite,
The strong king Emetreus did seize	The stronge kyng Emetreus gan hente
For before the sun went unto its rest,	For er the sonne unto the reste wente,
Some time there is an end of every deed.	Som tyme an ende ther is of every dede.
Out runs red blood on both their sides.	Out renneth blood on bothe hir sydes rede.
The fervent strokes bite on their helms;	The jelous strokes on hir helmes byte;
Nor of his prey desires so the blood,	Ne of his praye desireth so the blood,
That is hunted, or maddened by his hunger,	That hunted is, or for his hunger wood,
Nor in Benmarin there is not so fierce a lion,	Ne in Belmarye ther nys so fel leon,
For jealous heart upon this Palamon.	For jelous herte upon this Palamon.
So cruel on the hunt as is Arcite	So crueel on the hunte as is Arcite
When her whelp is stolen when it is little,	Whan that hir whelp is stole whan it is lite,
There was not any tiger in the vale of Gargaphia,	Ther nas no tygre in the vale of Galgopheye,
Each has unhorsed the other of them two.	Unhorsed hath ech oother of hem tweye.
Met together, and (each) wrought woe to his opponent;	Togydre ymet, and wroght his felawe wo;
To refresh themselves and drink, if they wish.	Hem to refresshe and drynken, if hem leste.
And for a while Theseus makes them rest,	And some tyme dooth hem Theseus to reste,
Another on that other side is led away.	Another lad is on that oother syde.
As was the agreement, right there he must abide.	As forward was, right there he moste abyde.
Despite all he can do, and brought unto the stake;	Maugree his heed, and broght unto the stake;
He is hurt through the body and then taken,	He thurgh the body is hurt and sithen ytake,
And he hurtles him down with his horse;	And he hym hurtleth with his hors adoun;
On his feet he stabs with the broken shaft of his spear,	He foyneth on his feet with his tronchoun,
He rolls under foot as does a ball;	He rolleth under foot as dooth a bal;
He did thrust through the thickest of the throng;	He thurgh the thikkeste of the throng gan threste;
With mighty maces they break the bones to pieces.	With myghty maces the bones they tobreste.
Out burst the blood in strong red streams;	Out brest the blood with stierne stremes rede;
The helms they hew to pieces and cut into shreds	The helmes they tohewen and toshrede;
Out go the swords bright as silver;	Out goon the swerdes as the silver brighte;
Up spring spears twenty foot on height;	Up spryngen speres twenty foot on highte;
He feels the stabbing through the breast-bone.	He feeleth thurgh the herte-spoon the prikke.
There splinter spears upon thick shields;	Ther shyveren shaftes upon sheeldes thikke;
There people see who can joust and who can ride;	Ther seen men who kan juste and who kan ryde;
In go the spears very firmly in the lance-rests;	In goon the speres ful sadly in arrest;
There is no more to say, but from west and east	Ther is namoore to seyn, but west and est
Now trumpets and bugles ring loud.	Now ryngen trompes loude and clarioun.
The heralds left their spurring up and down;	The heraudes lefte hir prikyng up and doun;
"Do now your duty, proud young knights!"	"Do now youre devoir, yonge knyghtes proude!"
Then the gates were shut, and cried was aloud:	Tho were the gates shet, and cried was loude:
So that in their total number there would be no deception,	That in hir nombre gyle were ther noon,
When every one of their names were read,	Whan that hir names rad were everichon,
And in two fair ranks they arrange themselves.	And in two renges faire they hem dresse.
In worthiness, nor in status, nor age,	Of worthynesse, ne of estaat, ne age,
That any one had advantage over the other	That any hadde of oother avauntage
For there was no one so wise that could say	For ther was noon so wys that koude seye
There were not two such companies,	Ther nere swiche compaignyes tweye,
So evenly, without variation,	So evene, withouten variacioun,
In all the world, to seek up and down,	In al the world, to seken up and doun,
With white banner and hardy countenance and face.	With baner whyt and hardy chiere and face.
Is under Venus, eastward in the place,	Is under Venus, estward in the place,
And in that same moment Palamon	And in that selve moment Palamon
Arcite, and also the hundred of his party,	Arcite, and eek the hondred of his parte,
And westward, through the gates under Mars,	And westward, thurgh the gates under Marte,
Unto the seats press all the crowd.	Unto the seetes preesseth al the route.
And other ladies about in tiers.	And othere ladys in degrees aboute.
Ypolita the queen, and Emelye,	Ypolita the queene, and Emelye,
When Theseus was set very splendidly and nobly,	Whan set was Theseus ful riche and hye,
It was not yet fully prime (nine a.m.) of the day	It nas nat of the day yet fully pryme
And they come to the lists in good time.	And to the lystes come they by tyme.
And thus they pass throughout the city,	And thus they passen thurghout the citee,
And after that another company	And after that another compaignye
And after rode the queen and Emelye,	And after rood the queene and Emelye,
These two Thebans upon either side,	Thise two Thebans upon either syde,
Fully like a lord this noble duke did ride,	Ful lik a lord this noble duc gan ryde,
Hung with cloth of gold, and not with serge.	Hanged with clooth of gold, and nat with sarge.
In battle array, throughout all the city,	By ordinance, thurghout the citee large,
And to the lists rides the company,	And to the lystes rit the compaignye,
Up go the trumpets and the melody,	Up goon the trompes and the melodye,
He desires no destruction of blood!"	He wilneth no destruccion of blood!"
So loudly they cried with merry voices,	So loude cride they with murie stevene,
The voice of people touched the heaven,	The voys of peple touchede the hevene,
Go now on your way; this is the lord's will."	Gooth now youre wey; this is the lordes wille."
With long sword and with mace fight your fill.	With long swerd and with mace fighteth youre fille.
God give you success! Go forth and lay on fast!	God spede you! Gooth forth and ley on faste!
The tournament shall last no longer.	No lenger shal the turneiynge laste.
On either side, or else should slay his opponent,	On outher syde, or elles sleen his make,
And if so happen that the chieftain be taken	And if so falle the chieftayn be take
But thither he must (go) by force, and remain there.	But thider he shal by force, and there abyde.
And not slain, but be brought unto the stake	And noght slayn, but be broght unto the stake
And he who is at a disadvantage shall be taken	And he that is at meschief shal be take
Let him thrust, if he wishes, on foot, to defend himself.	Foyne, if hym list, on foote, hymself to were.
More than one course with a sharply honed spear;	But o cours with a sharpe ygrounde spere;
And no man shall ride at his opponent	Ne no man shal unto his felawe ryde
May no man neither draw, nor bear it by his side.	No man ne drawe, ne bere it by his syde.
Nor short sword, to stab with piercing point,	Ne short swerd, for to stoke with poynt bitynge,
Send into the lists or bring there;	Into the lystes sende or thider brynge;
No sort of arrow, nor battle-axe, nor short knife	No maner shot, ne polax, ne short knyf
He will modify his previous plan.	He wol his firste purpos modifye.
Wherefore, to arrange matters so that they shall not die,	Wherfore, to shapen that they shal nat dye,
Of mortal battle now in this undertaking.	Of mortal bataille now in this emprise.
To gentle blood to fight in the manner	To gentil blood to fighten in the gyse
Considered that it would be destruction	Considered that it were destruccioun
"The lord has of his great sound judgment	"The lord hath of his heigh discrecioun
Then showed he the mighty duke's will:	Tho shewed he the myghty dukes wille:
And when he saw the people all still of noise,	And whan he saugh the peple of noyse al stille,
Until all the noise of people was done,	Til al the noyse of peple was ydo,
And also to hear his command and his decision.	And eek to herkne his heste and his sentence.
In order to see him, and to do great reverence,	Hym for to seen, and doon heigh reverence,
The people press thither full soon	The peple preesseth thiderward ful soone
Arrayed exactly as if he were a god on a throne.	Arrayed right as he were a god in trone.
Duke Theseus was set at a window,	Duc Theseus was at a wyndow set,
Honored, were fetched into the palace.	Honured, were into the paleys fet.
Until the Theban knights, both equally	Til that the Thebane knyghtes, bothe yliche
Remained yet in the chamber of his rich palace	Heeld yet the chambre of his paleys riche
By the music and noise that was made,	With mynstralcie and noyse that was maked,
Long after the sun began to rise.	Longe after that the sonne gan to sprynge.
Thus was the hall full of conjecturing,	Thus was the halle ful of divynynge,
"He has a battle-ax of twenty pounds of weight."	"He hath a sparth of twenty pound of wighte."
Some said he looked grim, and he would fight:	Somme seyde he looked grymme, and he wolde fighte:
Some with the bald, some with the thickly haired;	Somme with the balled, somme with the thikke herd;
Some held with him with the black beard,	Somme helden with hym with the blake berd,
Some said thus, some said "it shall be so";	Somme seyden thus, somme seyde "it shal be so";
Conjecturing about these two Theban knights.	Dyvynynge of thise Thebane knyghtes two.
Here three, there ten, debating,	Heere thre, ther ten, holdynge hir questioun,
That blow bloody sounds in the battle;	That in the bataille blowen blody sounes;
Pipes, trumpets, kettle drums, bugles,	Pypes, trompes, nakers, clariounes,
With short staves, thick as they can go;	With shorte staves, thikke as they may goon;
Yeomen on foot, and foot soldiers many a one	Yemen on foote, and communes many oon
With file and hammer are spurring to and fro;	With fyle and hamer prikynge to and fro;
Gnawing, and fast the armorers also	Gnawynge, and faste the armurers also
The steeds frothing on the golden bridles	The fomy steedes on the golden brydel
Where it is needed they were not at all idle;	There as nede is they weren no thyng ydel;
Fitting the shields with straps, fastening with laces --	Giggynge of sheeldes, with layneres lacynge --
Knights of (their) retinues, and also squires	Knyghtes of retenue, and eek squieres
Lords in richly decorated robes on their coursers,	Lordes in parementz on hir courseres,
Gold-colored helms, coats of mail, tunics with heraldic devices;	Gold-hewen helmes, coats of mail, cote-armures;
The bright shields, horses' head-armor, and horse-armor,	The sheeldes brighte, testeres, and trappures,
Of goldsmiths' works, of embroidery, and of steel;	Of goldsmythrye, of browdynge, and of steel;
So exotic and so rich, and wrought so well	So unkouth and so riche, and wroght so weel
There canst thou see preparation of armor	Ther maystow seen devisynge of harneys
Of lords upon steeds and palfreys.	Of lordes upon steedes and palfreys.
And to the palace there rode many a company	And to the paleys rood ther many a route
Noise and clattering of horses and armor	Of hors and harneys noyse and claterynge
And in the morning, when day did spring,	And on the morwe, whan that day gan sprynge,
Unto their rest they went at nightfall.	Unto hir reste wenten they at nyght.
Early, to see the great fight,	Eerly, for to seen the grete fight,
But because they must rise	But by the cause that they sholde ryse
And spend that day in Venus's noble service.	And spenden it in Venus heigh servyse.
That all that Monday they joust and dance,	That al that Monday justen they and daunce,
Made every person to be in such delight	Made every wight to been in swich plesaunce
And also the pleasing season of that May	And eek the lusty seson of that May
The essential part, for which I began.	The grete effect, for which that I bygan.
And tell you as plainly as I can	And telle yow as pleynly as I kan
Of Mars, and of Venus, goddess of love,	Of Mars, and of Venus, goddesse of love,
Now I will stop (speaking) of the gods above,	Now wol I stynten of the goddes above,
Weep now no more; I will fulfill thy desire."	Weep now namoore; I wol thy lust fulfille."
I am thy grandfather, ready (to do) as you wish;	I am thyn aiel, redy at thy wille;
Which daily causes such dissension.	That causeth al day swich divisioun.
Although you are not of one (the same) temperament,	Al be ye noght of o compleccioun,
Between you there must be peace sometime,	Bitwixe yow ther moot be som tyme pees,
Shall have his lady, as thou hast promised him.	Shal have his lady, as thou hast him hight.
So that Palamon, who is thine own knight,	That Palamon, that is thyn owene knyght,
Now weep no more; I shall do my diligence	Now weep namoore; I shal doon diligence
My (astrological) aspect is the father of pestilence.	My lookyng is the fader of pestilence.
The dark treasons, and the old plots;	The derke tresons, and the castes olde;
And mine are the cold maladies,	And myne be the maladyes colde,
I slew Sampson, shaking the pillar;	I slow Sampsoun, shakynge the piler;
Upon the miner or the carpenter.	Upon the mynour or the carpenter.
The falling of the towers and of the walls	The fallynge of the toures and of the walles
While I dwell in the (zodiacal) sign of the lion.	Whil I dwelle in the signe of the leoun.
I exact vengeance and do full punishment,	I do vengeance and pleyn correccioun,
The grumbling, and the secret poisoning;	The groynynge, and the pryvee empoysonyng;
The murmur (of discontent) and the churls' rebelling,	The murmure and the cherles rebellyng,
Mine is the killing and hanging by the throat,	Myn is the stranglyng and hangyng by the throte,
Mine is the imprisonment in the dark cell;	Myn is the prison in the derke cote;
Mine is the drowning in the sea so dark;	Myn is the drenchyng in the see so wan;
Has more power than any man knows.	Hath moore power than woot any man.
"My orbit, that has so wide (a course) to turn,	"My cours, that hath so wyde for to turne,
He found a remedy for all this strife.	Of al this strif he gan remedie fynde.
Although it is against his natural disposition,	Al be it that it is agayn his kynde,
Saturn anon, to stop strife and fear,	Saturne anon, to stynten strif and drede,
One can outrun the old but not outwit them.	Men may the olde atrenne and noght atrede.
In old age is both wisdom and experience;	In elde is bothe wysdom and usage;
As is truly said, old age has a great advantage;	As sooth is seyd, elde hath greet avantage;
That he full soon has pleased every side.	That he ful soone hath plesed every part.
Found in his old experience a plan	Foond in his olde experience an art
Who knew so many of old adventures,	That knew so manye of aventures olde,
That Jupiter was hard put to stop it,	That Juppiter was bisy it to stente,
And Mars, the stern god powerful in arms,	And Mars, the stierne god armypotente,
Between Venus, the goddess of love,	Bitwixe Venus, the goddesse of love,
Because of that same grant, in the heaven above,	For thilke grauntyng, in the hevene above,
And right away such strife there is begun,	And right anon swich strif ther is bigonne,
As happy as a fowl is for the bright sun.	As fayn as fowel is of the brighte sonne.
Arcite at once is gone unto his lodging,	Arcite anon unto his in is fare,
And thus with joy and hope to fare well	And thus with joye and hope wel to fare
For which he (Arcite) gave to Mars honor and glory.	For which he yaf to Mars honour and glorie.
And with that sound he heard a murmuring	And with that soun he herde a murmurynge
The statue of Mars began to ring its coat of mail,	The statue of Mars bigan his hauberk rynge,
With more other rites; and at the last	With othere rytes mo; and atte laste
And he cast more incense into the fire,	And moore encens into the fyr he caste,
And Arcite immediately raised up his hand,	And Arcita anon his hand up haf,
A sweet smell the ground at once yielded up,	A sweete smel the ground anon up yaf,
That it began to illuminate all the temple;	That it gan al the temple for to lighte;
The fires upon the altar burned (so) brightly	The fyres brenden upon the auter brighte
Of which Arcite was somewhat afraid.	Of which Arcita somwhat hym agaste.
The rings that hung on the temple door,	The rynges on the temple dore that honge,
The prayer of Arcite the strong stopped,	The preyere stynt of Arcita the stronge,
Give me victory; I ask of thee no more."	Yif me [victorie]; I aske thee namoore."
Now, lord, have pity upon my painful sorrows;	Now, lord, have routhe upon my sorwes soore;
And be thy true servant while I live.	And ben thy trewe servant whil I lyve.
Of razor nor of shears, I will give thee,	Of rasour nor of shere, I wol thee yive,
That never yet felt injury	That nevere yet ne felte offensioun
My beard, my hair, that hangs long down,	My beerd, myn heer, that hongeth long adoun,
And also I will bind myself to this vow:	And eek to this avow I wol me bynde:
And evermore, until that day I die,	And everemo, unto that day I dye,
And all the arms of my company,	And alle the armes of my compaignye,
And in thy temple I will hang my banner	And in thy temple I wol my baner honge
In thy pleasure and in thy strong crafts,	In thy plesaunce and in thy craftes stronge,
Over any place, and always most labor	Of any place, and alwey moost labouren
I will most honor thy most excellent temple	Thy sovereyn temple wol I moost honouren
Mine be the labor, and thine be the glory!	Myn be the travaille, and thyn be the glorie!
And bring it about so that I have victory tomorrow.	And do that I tomorwe have victorie.
As well as that same fire now burns me,	As wel as thilke fyr now brenneth me,
Then help me, lord, tomorrow in my battle,	Thanne help me, lord, tomorwe in my bataille,
Of thee my strength can not avail.	Of thee ne may my strengthe noght availle.
And well I know, without help or grace	And wel I woot, withouten help or grace
I must win her with strength in the lists,	I moot with strengthe wynne hire in the place,
And well I know, before she may promise me mercy,	And wel I woot, er she me mercy heete,
Nor cares never whether I sink or swim.	Ne reccheth nevere wher I synke or fleete.
For she that causes me to endure all this woe	For she that dooth me al this wo endure
Than ever was any living creature,	That evere was any lyves creature,
And, as I suppose, injured most by love	And, as I trowe, with love offended moost
Have pity as well upon my painful sufferings.	Have routhe as wel upon my peynes smerte.
For that same sorrow that was in thy heart,	For thilke sorwe that was in thyn herte,
And found thee lying by his wife, alas! --	And foond thee liggynge by his wyf, allas! --
When Vulcan had caught thee in his snare	Whan Vulcanus hadde caught thee in his las
Although once things went wrong for you,	Although thee ones on a tyme mysfille,
And haddest her in arms as you wished --	And haddest hire in armes at thy wille --
Of fair, young, fresh Venus the noble,	Of faire, yonge, fresshe Venus free,
When that thou enjoyed the beauty	Whan that thow usedest the beautee
In which thou once burned for desire,	In which thow whilom brendest for desir,
Then pray I thee to have pity upon my pain.	Thanne preye I thee to rewe upon my pyne.
Thy godhead, so that I may be one of thine,	Thy godhede, that I may been oon of thyne,
And that my power be worthy to serve	And that my myght be worthy for to serve
If it so be that my youth may deserve,	If so be that my youthe may deserve,
Accept of me my sorrowful sacrifice.	Accepte of me my pitous sacrifise.
And grants them fortune as it pleases thee to command.	And hem fortunest as thee lyst devyse,
All the control of arms in thy hand,	Of armes al the brydel in thyn hond,
And hast in every reign and every land	And hast in every regne and every lond
Of Thrace art honored and considered lord,	Of Trace honoured art and lord yholde,
Right thus to Mars he said his prayer:	Right thus to Mars he seyde his orisoun:
With sorrowful heart and intense devotion,	With pitous herte and heigh devocioun,
With all the rites of his pagan manner (of worship).	With alle the rytes of his payen wyse.
Of fierce Mars to do his sacrifice,	Of fierse Mars to doon his sacrifise,
Arcite has walked unto the temple	Arcite unto the temple walked is
The next (planetary) hour of Mars following this,	The nexte houre of Mars folwynge this,
This is the substance; there is no more to say.	This is th'effect; ther is namoore to seye.
And home she goes at once the nearest way.	And hoom she goth anon the nexte weye.
Diana, and in thy power."	Dyane, and in thy disposicioun."
And said, "What does this mean, alas?	And seyde, "What amounteth this, allas?
For which this Emelye was astonished,	For which this Emelye astoned was,
And forth she went and vanished;	And forth she wente and made a vanysshynge;
Of the goddess clatter fast and ring,	Of the goddesse clateren faste and rynge,
And with that word, the arrows in the quiver	And with that word, the arwes in the caas
Thy destiny concerning love, as in this situation."	Thyn aventure of love, as in this cas."
Shall declare to thee, before thou go hence,	Shulle thee declaren, er that thou go henne,
The fires which burn on my altar	The fires which that on myn auter brenne
Farwell, for I can stay no longer .	Farwel, for I ne may no lenger dwelle.
Who have for thee so much care and woe,	That han for thee so muchel care and wo,
Thou shalt be wedded unto one of those	Thou shalt ben wedded unto oon of tho
And by eternal word written and confirmed,	And by eterne word writen and confermed,
Among the high gods it is affirmed,	Among the goddes hye it is affermed,
And said, "Daughter, cease thy sadness.	And seyde, "Doghter, stynt thyn hevynesse.
With bow in hand, just like a huntress,	With bowe in honde, right as an hunteresse,
And right then Diana did appear,	And therwithal Dyane gan appeere,
And wept that it was a pity to hear.	And weep that it was pitee for to heere.
But simply for fear has she cried thus,	But oonly for the feere thus hath she cried,
That she was well nigh mad and began to cry,	That she was wel ny mad and gan to crye,
For which so sorely frightened was Emelye	For which so soore agast was Emelye
As if it were many bloody drops;	As it were blody dropes many oon;
And at the brand's end (the fire) ran out straightway	And at the brondes ende out ran anon
As these wet brands do in their burning,	As doon thise wete brondes in hir brennynge,
And as it quenched it made a roaring sound,	And as it queynte it made a whistelynge,
That other fire was quenched and all gone;	That oother fyr was queynt and al agon;
And rekindled again, and after that straightway	And quyked agayn, and after that anon
For right away one of the fires quenched	For right anon oon of the fyres queynte
While Emelye was thus in her prayer.	Whil Emelye was thus in hir preyere.
The fires burn brightly upon the altar,	The fires brenne upon the auter cleere,
And while I live, as a maiden I will serve thee."	And whil I lyve, a mayde I wol thee serve."
Thou care for and well conserve my maidenhood,	My maydenhede thou kepe and wel conserve,
Since thou art maiden and guardian of us all,	Syn thou art mayde and kepere of us alle,
The bitter tears that fall on my cheeks.	The bittre teeris that on my chekes falle.
Behold, goddess of clean chastity,	Bihoold, goddesse of clene chastitee,
Send me him who most desires me.	As sende me hym that moost desireth me.
That I must by necessity have one of them two,	That I shal nedes have oon of hem two,
And if it so be thou wilt not do me grace,	And if so be thou wolt nat do me grace,
Will be quenched, or turned to another place.	Be queynt, or turned in another place.
And all their intense torment, and their fire	And al hir bisy torment, and hir fir
That all their hot love and their desire,	That al hire hoote love and hir desir,
And turn away their hearts from me so	And fro me turne awey hir hertes so
Send love and peace between them two,	As sende love and pees bitwixe hem two,
This grace I pray thee and ask no more,	This grace I preye thee withoute moore,
And also Arcite, who loves me so painfully,	And eek Arcite, that loveth me so soore,
And Palamon, that has such love to me,	And Palamon, that hath swich love to me,
Now help me, lady, since you can and know how,	Now help me, lady, sith ye may and kan,
I do not desire to know company of man.	Noght wol I knowe compaignye of man.
And not to be a wife and be with child.	And noght to ben a wyf and be with childe.
And to walk in the wild woods,	And for to walken in the wodes wilde,
A maiden, and love hunting and the chase,	A mayde, and love huntynge and venerye,
I am, thou knowest, yet of thy company,	I am, thow woost, yet of thy compaignye,
Nor never will I be no lover nor wife.	Ne nevere wol I be no love ne wyf.
Desire to be a maiden all my life,	Desire to ben a mayden al my lyf,
Chaste goddess, well knowest thou that I	Chaste goddesse, wel wostow that I
Keep me from thy vengeance and thy ire,	As keepe me fro thy vengeaunce and thyn ire,
Full many a year, and knowest what I desire,	Ful many a yeer, and woost what I desire,
Goddess of maidens, whom my heart hast known	Goddesse of maydens, that myn herte hast knowe
Queen of the dark and low reign of Pluto,	Queene of the regne of Pluto derk and lowe,
To whom both heaven and earth and sea is visible,	To whom bothe hevene and erthe and see is sene,
"O chaste goddess of the green woods,	"O chaste goddesse of the wodes grene,
Unto Diana she spoke as you may hear:	Unto Dyane she spak as ye may heere:
When the fire was kindled, with a pitiful expression	Whan kyndled was the fyr, with pitous cheere
In Statius' Thebaid and such old books.	In Stace of Thebes and thise bookes olde.
Two fires on the altar did she kindle,	Two fyres on the auter gan she beete,
Was set upon her head full fair and suitable.	Upon hir heed was set ful fair and meete.
A crown of an evergreen oak	A coroune of a grene ook cerial
Her bright hair was combed, all loose;	Hir brighte heer was kembd, untressed al;
But it is good for a man to be without restriction (speak freely).	But it is good a man been at his large.
To one who means well it would be no matter of concern;	To hym that meneth wel it were no charge;
And yet it would be a pleasure to hear all.	And yet it were a game to heeren al.
Unless it be some thing in general;	But it be any thing in general;
But how she did her rite I dare not tell,	But hou she dide hir ryte I dar nat telle,
This Emelye, with gentle heart,	This Emelye, with herte debonaire,
The temple smoking (with incense), full of fair cloths,	Smokynge the temple, ful of clothes faire,
There lacked nothing (needed) to do her sacrifice.	Ther lakked noght to doon hir sacrifise.
The horns full of mead, as was the custom --	The hornes fulle of meeth, as was the gyse --
That is needed for the sacrifice;	That to the sacrifice longen shal;
The incense, the cloths, and all the rest	Th'encens, the clothes, and the remenant al
They had the fire full readily with them,	Ful redily with hem the fyr they hadde,
Her maidens, whom she led thither with her,	Hir maydens, that she thider with hire ladde,
And to the temple of Diana did hasten.	And to the temple of Dyane gan hye.
Began to go to Venus' temple,	Bigan to Venus temple for to gon,
The third planetary hour after Palamon	The thridde houre inequal that Palamon
And with glad heart he went home very soon.	And with glad herte he wente hym hoom ful soone.
Yet he knew well that his request was granted,	Yet wiste he wel that graunted was his boone,
For though the sign showed a delay,	For thogh the signe shewed a delay,
That his prayer was accepted that day.	That his preyere accepted was that day.
And made a sign, whereby he understood	And made a signe, wherby that he took
But at the last the statue of Venus shook,	But atte laste the statue of Venus shook,
Although I tell not now his observances;	Al telle I noght as now his observaunces;
He did his sacrifice, and that quickly,	His sacrifice he dide, and that anon,
When the prayer of Palamon was done,	Whan the orison was doon of Palamon,
Give me my love, thou blessed dear lady."	Yif me my love, thow blisful lady deere."
This is the substance and goal of my prayer:	This is th'effect and ende of my preyere:
Though Arcite win her to be his wife.	Though that Arcita wynne hire to his wyf.
Then I care not, when I have lost my life,	Thanne rekke I noght, whan I have lost my lyf,
That Arcite stab me through the heart.	That Arcita me thurgh the herte bere.
Then I pray thee, tomorrow with a spear	Thanne preye I thee, tomorwe with a spere
And if you will not (do) so, my lady sweet,	And if ye wol nat so, my lady sweete,
And on thy altar, whether I ride or walk (whatever I do),	And on thyn auter, where I ride or go,
I will worship thy temple evermore,	Thy temple wol I worshipe everemo,
That if you please, I shall well have my love.	That if yow list, I shal wel have my love.
Your power is so great in heaven above	Youre vertu is so greet in hevene above
For though it be true that Mars is god of arms,	For though so be that Mars is god of armes,
So that I have my lady in my arms.	So that I have my lady in myne armes.
To have victory over them, or they over me,	To have victorie of hem, or they of me,
I care not if it may better be	I recche nat but it may bettre be
Find thou the manner how and in what way:	Fynd thow the manere hou and in what wyse:
But I would have fully possession	But I wolde have fully possessioun
Nor fame for deeds of arms proclaimed everywhere;	Of pris of armes blowen up and doun;
Nor renown in this case, nor vain glory	Ne renoun in this cas, ne veyne glorie
Nor do I ask to have victory tomorrow,	Ne I ne axe nat tomorwe to have victorie,
I care not to boast of arms	I kepe noght of armes for to yelpe,
I make that my vow, providing you help me!	That make I myn avow, so ye me helpe!
And make war always against chastity.	And holden werre alwey with chastitee.
According to my power (as much as I can), be thy true servant,	Emforth my myght, thy trewe servant be,
As surely as I shall for evermore,	As wisly as I shal for everemoore,
My thought and seest what harms I feel!'	My thought and seest what harmes that I feele!'
But `Mercy, lady bright, who knowest well	But `Mercy, lady bright, that knowest weele
I am so befuddled that I can not say (anything)	I am so confus that I kan noght seye
My heart can not reveal my harms;	Myn herte may myne harmes nat biwreye;
The effects nor the torments of my hell;	Th'effectes ne the tormentz of myn helle;
Alas! I do not have any language to tell	Allas! I ne have no langage to telle
And take my humble prayer to thy heart.	And taak myn humble preyere at thyn herte.
Have pity on my bitter, smarting tears,	Have pitee of my bittre teeris smerte,
For that same love thou haddest to Adonis,	For thilke love thow haddest to Adoon,
Daughter to Jove and spouse of Vulcan,	Doughter to Jove and spouse of Vulcanus,
"Fairest of the fair, O lady mine, Venus,	"Faireste of faire, O lady myn, Venus,
And painful heart he said as you shall hear:	And herte soor he seyde as ye shal heere:
And down he kneels, and with humble expression	And doun he kneleth, and with humble cheere
Unto the lists where her temple was,	Unto the lystes ther hire temple was,
And in her (planetary) hour he walks forth slowly	And in hir houre he walketh forth a pas

Now comes the point, and listen if you please.	Now cometh the point, and herkneth if yow leste.
But (speak only) of the substance; that seems to me the best.	But al th' effect; that thynketh me the beste.

What hounds lie down on the floor --	What houndes liggen on the floor adoun --
What hawks sit on the perch above,	What haukes sitten on the perche above,
Or which of them can dance best and sing,	Or which of hem kan dauncen best and synge,
What ladies are fairest or best in dancing,	What ladyes fairest been or best daunsynge,

About nine a.m., and in the town dismounted.	Aboute pryme, and in the toun alight.

And in this manner these lords, one and all,	And in this wise thise lordes, alle and some,
Full many a tame lion and leopard.	Ful many a tame leon and leopart.
About this king there ran on all sides	Aboute this kyng ther ran on every part
For love and for the benefit of chivalry.	For love and for encrees of chivalrye.
For trust well that dukes, earls, kings	For trusteth wel that dukes, erles, kynges
Very richly in every detail.	Ful richely in alle maner thynges.
All armed, except for their heads, in all their equipment,	Al armed, save hir heddes, in al hir gere,
He had a hundred lords with him there,	An hundred lordes hadde he with hym there,
A tame eagle, white as any lily.	An egle tame, as any lilye whyt.
Upon his hand he carried for his delight	Upon his hand he bar for his deduyt
A garland, fresh and pleasing to look upon.	A gerland, fressh and lusty for to sene.
Upon his head he wore of green laurel	Upon his heed he wered of laurer grene
His voice was like a trumpet thundering.	His voys was as a trompe thonderynge.
I reckon his age at five and twenty years.	Of fyve and twenty yeer his age I caste.
And as a lion he cast about his look.	And as a leon he his lookyng caste.
Between yellow and somewhat mingled with black;	Bitwixen yelow and somdel blak ymeynd;
A few freckles were sprinkled in his face,	A fewe frakenes in his face yspreynd,
His lips round, his color was ruddy;	His lippes rounde, his colour was sangwyn;
His nose was high, his eyes bright lemon yellow,	His nose was heigh, his eyen bright citryn,
And that was yellow, and glittered like the sun.	And that was yelow, and glytered as the sonne.
His curly hair like rings was run (fashioned),	His crispe heer lyk rynges was yronne,
Brimful of rubies red as sparkling fire;	Bret-ful of rubyes rede as fyr sparklynge;

Adorned with pearls white and round and big;	Couched with perles white and rounde and grete;

Came riding like the god of arms, Mars.	Cam ridynge lyk the god of armes, Mars.
Covered in cloth of gold, well decorated (with geometric patterns),	Covered in clooth of gold, dyapred weel,
Upon a reddish-brown steed with trappings of steel,	Upon a steede bay trapped in steel,
The great Emetreus, the king of India,	The grete Emetreus, the kyng of Inde,
With Arcite, as people find in histories,	With Arcita, in stories as men fynde,
Very well armed, with stern and stout hearts.	Armed ful wel, with hertes stierne and stoute.
Wearing collars of gold, and rings for leashes filed round.	Colered of gold, and tourettes fyled rounde.
And followed him with muzzles securely bound,	And folwed hym with mosel faste ybounde,
To hunt for the lion or the deer,	To hunten at the leoun or the deer,
Twenty and more, as big as any steer,	Twenty and mo, as grete as any steer,
About his chariot there went white wolfhounds,	Aboute his chaar ther wenten white alauntz,
Of fine rubies and of diamonds.	Of fyne rubyes and of dyamauntz.
Upon his head, set full of bright stones,	Upon his heed, set ful of stones brighte,
A wreath of gold, thick as an arm, of huge weight,	A wrethe of gold, arm-greet, of huge wighte,
Like any raven's feather it shone because of its blackness;	As any ravenes fethere it shoon for blak;
He had a bear's skin, coal-black because of age.	He hadde a beres skyn, col-blak for old.
With claws yellow and bright as any gold,	With nayles yelewe and brighte as any gold,
Instead of a tunic with his coat of arms over his armor,	In stede of cote-armure over his harnays,
With four white bulls in the traces.	With foure white boles in the trays.

His shoulders broad, his arms round and long;	His shuldres brode, his armes rounde and longe;

Black was his beard, and manly was his face;	Blak was his berd, and manly was his face;

But this is yet the best joke of all,	But this is yet the beste game of alle,
Those who serve love, whatever may happen.	That serven love, for aught that may bifalle.
And yet they consider themselves very wise,	And yet they wenen for to been ful wyse
Thus has their lord, the god of love, paid	Thus hath hir lord, the god of love, ypayed
See how they bleed! Are they not in fine condition?	Se how they blede! Be they noght wel arrayed?
Behold, for the sake of God who sits above,	Bihoold, for Goddes sake that sit above,
Who can be a fool unless he is in love?	Who may been a fool but if he love?
Now look, is that not a great folly?	Now looketh, is nat that an heigh folye?
Brought them both hither to die.	Broght hem hyder bothe for to dye.
And yet has Love, despite anything they could do,	And yet hath love, maugree hir eyen two,

That in such cases knows no distinctions	That in swich cas kan no divisioun
That lord has little sound judgment,	That lord hath litel of discrecioun,
Who will persist in what he first began.	That wol mayntene that he first bigan.

To those who are in repentance and fear,	To hem that been in repentaunce and drede,
But be a lion, both in word and deed,	But been a leon, bothe in word and dede,
Upon a lord that will have no mercy,	Upon a lord that wol have no mercy,
And in his gentle heart he thought straightway,	And in his gentil herte he thoughte anon,
Of women, for they weep continually,	Of wommen, for they wepen evere in oon,
And also his heart had compassion	And eek his herte hadde compassioun
And also deliver himself out of prison.	And eek delivere hymself out of prisoun.
Will help himself in love, if he can,	Wol helpe hymself in love, if that he kan,
As thus: he thought well that every man	As thus: he thoghte wel that every man
Yet in his reason he excused them both,	Yet in his resoun he hem bothe excused,
And although his anger reproached them for their guilt,	And although that his ire hir gilt accused,
The trespass of them both, and also the cause,	The trespas of hem bothe, and eek the cause,
And though he first for anger shook and trembled,	And though he first for ire quook and sterte,
For pity comes soon to a gentle heart.	For pitee renneth soone in gentil herte.
Until at the last his mood was calmed,	Til at the laste aslaked was his mood,
And would have kissed his feet there where he stood;	And wolde have kist his feet ther as he stood;
And they fall down on their bare knees	And on hir bare knees adoun they falle
"Have mercy, Lord, upon all of us women!"	"Have mercy, Lord, upon us wommen alle!"
And all cried, both low ranking and high,	And alle crieden, bothe lasse and moore,
And saw their bloody wounds wide and sore,	And saugh hir blody woundes wyde and soore,
And this debate was for nothing but love;	And no thyng but for love was this debaat;
That ever such a misfortune should occur,	That evere swich a chaunce sholde falle,
Great pity was it, as it seemed to them all,	Greet pitee was it, as it thoughte hem alle,
And all the ladies in the company.	And alle the ladyes in the compaignye.
Began to weep, and so did Emelye,	Gan for to wepe, and so dide Emelye,
The queen at once, for true womanliness,	The queene anon, for verray wommanhede,
You shall be dead, by mighty Mars the red!"	Ye shal be deed, by myghty Mars the rede!"
There is no deed to torture you with the cord.	It nedeth noght to pyne yow with the corde.
Has condemned you, and I will pronounce it;	Hath dampned yow, and I wol it recorde;
Your own mouth, by your confession,	Youre owene mouth, by youre confessioun,
This worthy duke answered at once in reply,	This worthy duc answerde anon agayn,
For we have both deserved to be slain."	For bothe han we deserved to be slayn."
But slay my fellow in the same way,	But sle my felawe in the same wise,
Therefore I ask death and my judicial sentence;	Wherfore I axe deeth and my juwise;
That I will die at this moment in her sight.	That I wol dye present in hir sighte.
Who loves the beautiful Emelye so passionately	That loveth so hoote Emelye the brighte
I am thy mortal foe, and it is I	I am thy mortal foo, and it am I
That wickedly has broken (out of) thy prison.	That hath thy prisoun broken wikkedly.
That I am that same woeful Palamon	That I am thilke woful Palamoun
For since the day is come that I must dye,	For sith the day is come that I shal dye,
And this is he that loves Emelye.	And this is he that loveth Emelye.
And thou hast made him thy chief squire;	And thou hast maked hym thy chief squier;
Thus has he tricked thee for many years,	Thus hath he japed thee ful many a yer,
And said that he was called Philostrate.	And seyde that he highte Philostrate.
For this is he that came unto thy gate	For this is he that cam unto thy gate
For which he has deserved to be dead.	For which he hath deserved to be deed.
Who is banished from thy land on (pain of losing) his head,	That fro thy lond is banysshed on his heed,
This is thy mortal foe, this is Arcite,	This is thy mortal foo, this is Arcite,
But slay my fellow also as well as me;	But sle my felawe eek as wel as me;
But slay me first, by holy charity!	But sle me first, for seinte charitee!
Give us neither mercy nor refuge,	Ne yif us neither mercy ne refuge,
And as thou art a rightful lord and judge,	And as thou art a rightful lord and juge,
Who are burdened down by our own lives;	That been encombred of oure owene lyves;
Two woeful wretches are we, two miserable people,	Two woful wrecches been we, two caytyves,
We have deserved the death, both of us two.	We have the deeth disserved bothe two.
And said, "Sire, what more words are needed?	And seyde, "Sire, what nedeth wordes mo?
This Palamon answered hastily	This Palamon answerde hastily
Without judge or other officer,	Withouten juge or oother officere,
Who are so bold as to fight here	That been so hardy for to fighten heere
But tell me what sort of men you are,	But telleth me what myster men ye been,
Who smites any stroke that I can see.	That smyteth any strook that I may seen.
By mighty Mars, he shall at once be dead	By myghty Mars, he shal anon be deed
No more, on the penalty of the loss of your head!	Namoore, up peyne of lesynge of youre heed!
And pulled out a sword and cried, "Stop!	And pulled out a swerd and cride, "Hoo!
And with a sudden leap he was between them two,	And at a stert he was bitwix hem two,
This duke smote his warhorse with his spurs,	This duc his courser with his spores smoot,
It seemed as if it would fell an oak.	It semed as it wolde felle an ook.
So hideously that with the weakest stroke	So hidously that with the leeste strook
The bright swords went to and fro	The brighte swerdes wenten to and fro
Who fought as fiercely as if it were two wild boars.	That foughten breme as it were bores two.
He was aware of Arcite and Palamon,	He was war of Arcite and Palamon,
He looks toward the sun, and immediately	Under the sonne he looketh, and anon
And when this duke was come unto the glade,	And whan this duc was come unto the launde,
With such hounds as he pleases to command.	With houndes swiche as that hym list comaunde.
This duke will have a run or two at him	This duc wol han a cours at hym or tweye
For through there the hart was accustomed to take his escape,	For thider was the hert wont have his flight,
And directly to the glade he rides,	And to the launde he rideth hym ful right,
Duke Theseus has held the straight way.	Duc Theseus the streighte wey hath holde.
In which there was a hart, so people told him,	In which ther was an hert, as men hym tolde,
And to the grove that stood very close by,	And to the grove that stood ful faste by,
On hunting they are ridden royally.	On huntyng be they riden roially.
And Emelye, clothed all in green,	And Emelye, clothed al in grene,
With his Ypolita, the faire queen,	With his Ypolita, the faire queene,
And Theseus with all joy and bliss,	And Theseus with alle joye and blis,
For next to Mars he now serves Diana.	For after Mars he serveth now Dyane.
To be himself the large hart's slayer,	To been hymself the grete hertes bane,
That it is all his joy and desire	That it is al his joye and appetit
For in his hunting he has such delight	For in his huntyng hath he swich delit
With huntsman and horn and hounds beside him.	With hunte and horn and houndes hym bisyde.
That he is not clad, and ready to ride	That he nys clad, and redy for to ryde
That in his bed there dawns for him no day	That in his bed ther daweth hym no day
And especially at the large hart in May,	And namely at the grete hert in May,
Who is so desirous to hunt,	That for to hunten is so desirus,
All this is ruled by the foresight above.	Al is this reuled by the sighte above.
Be it of war, or peace, or hate, or love,	Be it of werre, or pees, or hate, or love,
For certainly, our desires here,	For certeinly, oure appetites heer,
That happens not again in a thousand years.	That falleth nat eft withinne a thousand yeer.
Yet sometimes it shall happen on one day	Yet somtyme it shal fallen on a day
The contrary of a thing by yes or no,	The contrarie of a thyng by ye or nay,
So strong it is that, though the world had sworn	So strong it is that, though the world had sworn
The providence that God has foreseen,	The purveiaunce that God hath seyn biforn,
That executes in the world everywhere	That executeth in the world over al
And forth I will tell you of Theseus.	And forth I wole of Theseus yow telle.
And in this manner I leave them to remain fighting,	And in this wise I lete hem fightyng dwelle,
They fought up to the ankle in their blood.	Up to the ancle foghte they in hir blood.
That froth at the mouth white as foam for mad anger.	That frothen whit as foom for ire wood.
They began to smite like wild boars,	As wilde bores gonne they to smyte,
And Arcite was like a cruel tiger;	And as a crueel tigre was Arcite;
In his fighting was a mad lion,	In his fightyng were a wood leon,
Thou mightest suppose that this Palamon	Thou myghtest wene that this Palamon
They thrust at each other a wonderfully long time.	They foynen ech at oother wonder longe.
As friendly as if he were his own brother;	As freendly as he were his owene brother;
Each one of them helped to arm the other	Everich of hem heelp for to armen oother
But straightway, without word or conversing,	But streight, withouten word or rehersyng,
There was no 'good day,' nor no salutations,	Ther nas no good day, ne no saluyng,
When each of them knew the other.	As fer as everich of hem oother knewe.
So fared they in changing colors of their faces,	So ferden they in chaungyng of hir hewe,
Or he must slay me, if I suffer misfortune."	Or he moot sleen me, if that me myshappe."
For either I must slay him at the gap,	For outher I moot sleen hym at the gappe,
Without fail, he must be dead, or I,	Withoute faille, he moot be deed, or I,
And breaks both boughs and the leaves,	And breketh bothe bowes and the leves,
And hears him come rushing in the bushes,	And hereth hym come russhyng in the greves,
When the lion or the bear is hunted,	Whan hunted is the leon or the bere,
He who stands at the gap in the forrest with a spear,	That stondeth at the gappe with a spere,
Just as the hunters in the reign of Thrace,	Right as the hunters in the regne of Trace,
The color in their faces began to change;	To chaungen gan the colour in hir face;
This Arcite and this Palamon are met.	This Arcite and this Palamon ben met.
And in the grove, at time and place set,	And in the grove, at tyme and place yset,
He carries all the armor before him.	He carieth al the harneys hym biforn.
The battle in the field between them two;	The bataille in the feeld bitwix hem tweyne;
Both sufficient and suitable to decide	Bothe suffisaunt and mete to darreyne
Very secretly he has prepared two sets of armor,	Ful prively two harneys hath he dight,
And on the morning, before it was day's light,	And on the morwe, er it were dayes light,
Arcite has ridden immediately into the town,	Arcite is riden anon unto the toun,
Arcite and Palamon well find that (to be true).	Wel fynden that Arcite and Palamoun.
Will not, willingly, have any partnership.	Wol noght, his thankes, have no felaweshipe.
Full truly it is said that love nor lordship	Ful sooth is seyd that love ne lordshipe
O reign, that will have no partner with thee!	O regne, that wolt no felawe have with thee!
When each of them had laid his faith as a pledge.	Whan ech of hem had leyd his feith to borwe.
And thus they are departed until morning,	And thus they been departed til amorwe,
This Palamon answered, "I agree."	This Palamon answerde, "I graunte it thee."
Thou mayest well have thy lady as far as I am concerned."	Thow mayst wel have thy lady as for me."
And slay me in this wood where I am in,	And sle me in this wode ther I am inne,
And if it so be that thou win my lady,	And if so be that thou my lady wynne,
Enough for thee, and bed-clothes for thy bedding.	Ynough for thee, and clothes for thy beddynge.
And food and drink this night will I bring	And mete and drynke this nyght wol I brynge
And choose the best, and leave the worst for me.	And ches the beste, and leef the worste for me.
But here I will be found as a knight,	That heere I wol be founden as a knyght,
Without the knowledge of any other person,	Withoute wityng of any oother wight,
Have here my pledge; tomorrow I will not fail,	Have heer my trouthe; tomorwe I wol nat faille,
And desire to decide the right to her by battle,	And wilnest to darreyne hire by bataille,
But for as much as thou art a worthy knight	But for as muche thou art a worthy knyght
And I will love her in spite of all thy might!	And I wol love hire maugree al thy myght!
Lo! True fool, think well that love is free,	What! Verray fool, thynk wel that love is free,
Which thou sayest that I have made to thee.	Which that thou seist that I have maad to thee.
For I repudiate the pledge and the bond	For I defye the seurete and the bond
Thou shouldest never walk out of this grove,	Thou sholdest nevere out of this grove pace,
And also because thou hast no weapon in this place,	And eek that thow no wepne hast in this place,
Were it not that thou art sick and mad for love,	Nere it that thou art sik and wood for love,
And said thus: "By God who sits above,	And seyde thus: "By God that sit above,
As fierce as a lion pulled out his sword,	As fiers as leon pulled out his swerd,
When he knew him, and had heard his tale,	Whan he hym knew, and hadde his tale herd,
This Arcite, with full spiteful heart,	This Arcite, with ful despitous herte,
Choose which thou wish, or thou shalt not escape!"	Chees which thou wolt, or thou shalt nat asterte!"
Either thou shalt not love Emelye,	Or thow ne shalt nat loven Emelye.
But out of prison am escaped by good luck,	But out of prison am astert by grace,
And though I have no weapon in this place,	And though that I no wepene have in this place,
For I am Palamon, thy mortal foe.	For I am Palamon, thy mortal foo.
But I will love her only and no other;	But I wol love hire oonly and namo;
Thou shalt not love my lady Emelye,	Thou shalt nat love my lady Emelye,
I will be dead, or else thou shalt die.	I wol be deed, or elles thou shalt dye.
And thus hast falsely changed thy name!	And falsly chaunged hast thy name thus!
And hast tricked here duke Theseus,	And hast byjaped heere duc Theseus,
As I full often have told thee before now,	As I ful ofte have told thee heerbiforn,
For whom that I have all this pain and woe,	For whom that I have al this peyne and wo,
Now art thou taken, who lovest my lady so,	Now artow hent, that lovest my lady so,
And said: "Arcite, false, wicked traitor,	And seide: "Arcite, false traytour wikke,
He leaped up out of the thick bushes	He stirte hym up out of the buskes thikke
As if he were mad, with face dead and pale,	As he were wood, with face deed and pale,
And when he had heard Arcite's tale,	And whan that he had herd Arcites tale,
For anger he trembled; no longer would he wait.	For ire he quook; no lenger wolde he byde.
He felt a cold sword suddenly glide,	He felte a coold swerd sodeynliche glyde,
This Palamon, that thought that through his heart	This Palamoun, that thoughte that thurgh his herte
And with that word he fell down in a trance	And with that word he fil doun in a traunce
Provided that I could do anything to please you."	So that I koude doon aught to youre plesaunce."
I do not reckon at the value of a weed,	Ne sette I nat the montance of a tare,
Of all the rest of my other troubles	Of al the remenant of myn oother care
You are the cause by which I die.	Ye been the cause wherfore that I dye.
You slay me with your eyes, Emelye!	Ye sleen me with youre eyen, Emelye!
That my death was destined before my first garment was made.	That shapen was my deeth erst than my sherte.
Stabbed through my faithful, sorrowful heart	Ystiked thurgh my trewe, careful herte
Love has his fiery dart so ardently	Love hath his firy dart so brennyngly
Whom Theseus torments in prison.	That Theseus martireth in prisoun.
Save only me and wretched Palamon,	Save oonly me and wrecched Palamoun,
Thus has your anger destroyed all our lineage,	Thus hath youre ire oure lynage al fordo,
Alas, thou fierce Mars! Alas, Juno!	Allas, thou felle Mars! Allas, Juno!
Now I am called Philostrate, not worth a penny.	Now highte I Philostrate, noght worth a myte.
But whereas I was accustomed to be called Arcite,	But ther as I was wont to highte Arcite,
For I dare not acknowledge my own name;	For I dar noght biknowe myn owene name;
And yet Juno does me much more shame,	And yet dooth Juno me wel moore shame,
I meekly serve him as his squire.	I serve hym as his squier povrely.
And now I am so wretched and so enslaved,	And now I am so caytyf and so thral,
By true lineage, of the royal family,	By verray ligne, as of the stok roial,
I am of his lineage and his offspring	Of his lynage am I and his ofspryng
And first was crowned king of the city.	And of the citee first was crouned kyng.
Who built Thebes, before the town first began,	That Thebes bulte, or first the toun bigan,
Of Cadmus, who was the first man	Of Cadmus, which that was the firste man
The royal blood of Cadmus and Amphion --	The blood roial of Cadme and Amphioun --
Alas, to ruin is brought	Allas, ybroght is to confusioun
Wilt thou make war on the city of Thebes?	Woltow werreyen Thebes the citee?
"Alas," he said, "that day that I was born!	"Allas," quod he, "that day that I was bore!
And sat himself down without any more.	And sette hym doun withouten any moore.
When Arcite had sung, he began to sigh	Whan that Arcite had songe, he gan to sike
Friday is seldom like all the rest of the week.	Selde is the Friday al the wowke ylike.
Is changeable, just so she changes her array.	Is gereful, right so chaungeth she array.
The hearts of her folk; just as her day	The hertes of hir folk; right as hir day
Just so can fickle Venus sadden	Right so kan geery Venus overcaste
Now it shines, now it rains hard,	Now it shyneth, now it reyneth faste,
Exactly like the Friday, truly for to tell,	Right as the Friday, soothly for to telle,
Now in the tree top, now down in the briars,	Now in the crope, now doun in the breres,
As these lovers do in their strange manners,	As doon thise loveres in hir queynte geres,
He fell suddenly into a state of anxiety,	Into a studie he fil sodeynly,
And sung all the rondel cheerfully,	And songen al the roundel lustily,
When Arcite had roamed all his fill,	Whan that Arcite hadde romed al his fille,
For in the thicket he sits now very still.	For in the bussh he sitteth now ful stille.
Who was near enough to hear all his speech,	That was so ny to herknen al his sawe,
Arcite knows full little of his fellow,	Ful litel woot Arcite of his felawe,
For every day people meet at unexpected times.	For al day meeteth men at unset stevene.
That "field has eyes and the wood has ears."	That "feeld hath eyen and the wode hath eres."
But truly it is said, since many years ago,	But sooth is seyd, go sithen many yeres,
God knows he would scarcely have believed it	God woot he wolde have trowed it ful lite.
In no way did he know that it was Arcite;	No thyng ne knew he that it was Arcite;
For he was sorely afraid of his death.	For soore afered of his deeth was he.
Was in a thicket, so that no man could see him,	Was in a bussh, that no man myghte hym se,
Where by chance this Palamon	Ther as by aventure this Palamoun
And in a path he roams up and down,	And in a path he rometh up and doun,
He rushed into the grove hastily,	Into the grove ful hastily he sterte,
In hope that I can get something green."	In hope that I som grene gete may."
Welcome be thou, fair, fresh May,	Welcome be thou, faire, fresshe May,
"May, with all thy flowers and thy greenery,	"May, with alle thy floures and thy grene,
And loud he sang in the bright sun:	And loude he song ayeyn the sonne shene:
Were it of woodbine or hawthorn leaves,	Were it of wodebynde or hawethorn leves,
To make himself a garland of the branches,	To maken hym a gerland of the greves,
By chance he began to hold his way	By aventure his wey he gan to holde
And to the grove of which I told you	And to the grove of which that I yow tolde
Out of the court, about a mile or two.	Out of the court, were it a myle or tweye.
He on a war horse, leaping about like the fire,	He on a courser, startlynge as the fir,
Meditating on the object of his desire,	Remembrynge on the poynt of his desir,
And to do his observance to May,	And for to doon his observaunce to May,
Is risen and looks on the merry day.	Is risen and looketh on the myrie day.
With Theseus is chief squire,	With Theseus is principal squier,
And Arcite, who in the royal court	And Arcita, that in the court roial
The silver drops hanging on the leaves.	The silver dropes hangynge on the leves.
And with his rays dries in the groves	And with his stremes dryeth in the greves
That all the orient laughs because of the light,	That al the orient laugheth of the light,
Salutes the morning gray in her song,	Salueth in hir song the morwe gray,
The busy lark, messenger of day,	The bisy larke, messager of day,
To which Fortune had brought him in the snare.	Til that Fortune had broght him in the snare.
That little knew how near his trouble was,	That litel wiste how ny that was his care,
Now I will turn again to Arcite,	Now wol I turne to Arcite ageyn,
This is the purpose and his full intent.	This is th'effect and his entente pleyn.
Or win Emelye to be his wife.	Or wynnen Emelye unto his wyf.
And shortly, he would either lose his life	And shortly, outher he wolde lese his lif
To help him to wage war on Theseus;	On Theseus to helpe him to werreye;
And in the night then he would take his way	And in the nyght thanne wolde he take his way
That in that grove he would hide himself all day,	That in that grove he wolde hym hyde al day,
For, shortly, this was his idea:	For, shortly, this was his opinion:
With fearful foot then stalks Palamon.	With dredeful foot thanne stalketh Palamon.
And to a grove close by	And til a grove faste ther bisyde
So that by necessity he must hide himself,	That nedes cost he moot hymselven hyde,
The night was short and very close to the day	The nyght was short and faste by the day
And thus he flees as fast as ever he can.	And thus he fleeth as faste as evere he may.
The jailer slept; he could not awake.	The gayler sleep; he myghte nat awake.
With narcotics and pure opium of Thebes,	With nercotikes and opie of Thebes fyn,
Of a spiced and sweetened drink made of a certain wine,	Of a clarree maad of a certeyn wyn,
For he had so given his jailer drink	For he hadde yeve his gayler drynke so
And flees the city as fast as he can go.	And fleeth the citee faste as he may go.
With the help of a friend, broke out of his prison	By helpyng of a freend, brak his prisoun
That soon after midnight Palamon,	That soone after the mydnyght Palamoun,
As, when a thing is pre-ordained, it must be --	As, whan a thyng is shapen, it shal be --
Whether it was by chance or fate --	Were it by aventure or destynee --

Therefore I pass on as quickly as I can.	Therfore I passe as lightly as I may.
His martyrdom? In truth it is not I;	His martirdom? For sothe it am nat I;
Who could rime in English properly	Who koude ryme in Englyssh proprely
Perpetually, not just for a year.	Perpetuelly, noght oonly for a yer.
And also moreover he is a prisoner	And eek therto he is a prisoner
That he goes mad, out of his wits because of woe?	That wood out of his wit he goth for wo?
But Palamon, whom love so afflicts	But Palamon, that love destreyneth so
Who feels double pain and sadness	Who feeleth double soor and hevynesse
These seven years Palamon has sat	Thise seven yeer hath seten Palamoun
In darkness and horrible and strong imprisonment	In derknesse and horrible and strong prisoun
And I will speak of Palamon a little.	And speke I wole of Palamon a lite.
And in this bliss I now leave Arcite,	And in this blisse lete I now Arcite,
There was no man whom Theseus holds dearer.	Ther was no man that Theseus hath derre.
And conducted himself so that, in peace and also in war,	And bar hym so, in pees and eek in werre,
And three years in this manner he led his life,	And thre yeer in this wise his lif he ladde,
So that no man wondered how he acquired it.	That no man wondred how that he it hadde.
But properly and slyly he spent it,	But honestly and slyly he it spente,
And also men brought him out of his country,	And eek men broghte hym out of his contree,
And gave him gold to maintain (a life style suitable to) his rank.	And gaf hym gold to mayntene his degree.
That he has made him a squire of his chamber,	That of his chambre he made hym a squier,
That Theseus has taken him so near	That Theseus hath taken hym so neer
Both for his deeds and his good speech,	Bothe of his dedes and his goode tonge,
And thus within a short time his fame is sprung,	And thus withinne a while his name is spronge,
Where he could exercise his abilities.	Ther as he myghte his vertu excercise.
And put him in noble employment,	And putten hym in worshipful servyse,
If Theseus would advance his rank,	That Theseus wolde enhauncen his degree,
That his fame was (spread) throughout all the court .	That thurghout al the court was his renoun.
He was so noble in manner	He was so gentil of condicioun
Was never in court (anyone) of his rank;	Ne was ther nevere in court of his degree;
But half so well beloved a man as he	But half so wel biloved a man as he
And he said that he was called Philostrate.	And Philostrate he seyde that he highte.

A year or two he was in this service,	A yeer or two he was in this servyse,
To do what any one can command him.	To doon that any wight kan hym devyse.
And moreover he was tall and strong of bones	And therto he was long and big of bones
He could well hew wood, and carry water,	Wel koude he hewen wode, and water bere,
Of every servant, who serves here.	Of every servaunt, which that serveth here.
For he was wise and could soon take the measure	For he was wys and koude soone espye,
Who was dwelling with Emelye,	The which that dwellynge was with Emelye,

To drudge and draw water, whatever men will command.	To drugge and drawe, what so men wol devyse.
And at the gate he offers his service	And at the gate he profreth his servyse
And to the court he went upon a day,	And to the court he wente upon a day,
Who was disguised as poorly as he was,	Which was disgised povrely as he was,
Who knew his private affairs and all his situation,	That knew his privetee and al his cas,
And all alone, except only a squire	And al allone, save oonly a squier
And clad himself as a poor laborer,	And cladde hym as a povre laborer,
And right away he changed his clothing,	And right anon he chaunged his array,
And see his lady almost every day.	And seen his lady wel ny day by day.

By the malady which he had endured,	Of maladye the which he hadde endured,
And right away it ran to him in his mind,	And right anon it ran hym in his mynde,
And saw his visage all (changed) to another sort.	And saugh his visage al in another kynde.
And saw that all his color was changed,	And saugh that chaunged was al his colour,
And with that word he picked up a large mirror,	And with that word he caughte a greet mirour,
In her presence I care not if I die."	In hire presence I recche nat to sterve."
From seeing my lady, whom I love and serve.	To se my lady, that I love and serve.
Nor shall I refrain for the dread of death	Ne for the drede of deeth shal I nat spare
Said he, "I will go to Athens right now,	Quod he, "to Atthenes right now wol I fare,
"Now truly, however sorely it may pain me,"	"Now trewely, hou soore that me smerte,"
Where an end of thy woe is destined for thee."	Ther is thee shapen of thy wo an ende."
And said to him thus: "To Athens shalt thou go,	And seyde hym thus: "To Atthenes shaltou wende,
As he was when he put Argus to sleep;	As he was whan that Argus took his sleep;
This god was dressed, as he (Arcite) noticed,	Arrayed was this god, as he took keep,
He wore a hat upon his bright hair.	An hat he werede upon his heris brighte.
His sleep-inducing staff he carried upright in his hand;	His slepy yerde in hond he bar uprighte;
Stood before him and commanded him to be merry.	Biforn hym stood and bad hym to be murie.
It seemed to him that the winged god Mercury	Hym thoughte how that the wynged god Mercurie
Upon one night as he laid himself in sleep,	Upon a nyght in sleep as he hym leyde,
This cruel torment and this pain and woe,	This crueel torment and this peyne and wo,

Why should I all daylong write of his woe?	What sholde I al day of his wo endite?
Of him, this woeful lover dan Arcite.	Of hym, this woful lovere daun Arcite.

And shortly, all was turned topsy-turvy	And shortly, turned was al up so doun
In the front lobe, in his imagination.	Biforen, in his celle fantastik.
Engendered by the melancholic humor	Engendred of humour malencolik
Of Hereos, but rather like mania,	Of Hereos, but rather lyk manye,
And in his behavior for all the world he fared	And in his geere for al the world he ferde
His speech nor his voice, though men heard it.	His speche nor his voys, though men it herde.
And changed so, that no man could know	And chaunged so, that no man koude knowe
So feeble also were his spirits, and so low,	So feble eek were his spiritz, and so lowe,
Then would he weep, he could not be stopped.	Thanne wolde he wepe, he myghte nat be stent.
And if he heard song or instrument,	And if he herde song or instrument,
And wailing all the night, making his moan;	And waillynge al the nyght, makynge his mone;
And he was solitary and ever alone,	And solitarie he was and evere allone,
His hue sickly yellow and pale as cold ashes,	His hewe falow and pale as asshen colde,
So that he became lean and dry as is a stick;	That lene he wex and drye as is a shaft;
He is bereft of his sleep, his food, his drink	His slep, his mete, his drynke, is hym biraft,
That is, or shall (be), while the world may endure.	That is, or shal, whil that the world may dure.
So much sorrow never had creature	So muche sorwe hadde nevere creature
And shortly to conclude (telling) all his woe,	And shortly to concluden al his wo,
For he shall never more see his lady.	For seen his lady shal he nevere mo.
Very often each day he grew faint and said "Alas!"	Ful ofte a day he swelte and seyde "Allas!"
When Arcite was come to Thebes,	Whan that Arcite to Thebes comen was,
For I will tell forth as I began.	For I wol telle forth as I bigan.
But he shall see his lady nevermore.	But seen his lady shal he nevere mo.
That other where he pleases may ride or walk,	That oother wher hym list may ride or go,
But in prison he must always dwell;	But in prison he moot dwelle alway;
That one may see his lady every day,	That oon may seen his lady day by day,
Who has the worse, Arcite or Palamon?	Who hath the worse, Arcite or Palamoun?
Yow lovers now I ask this question:	Yow loveres axe I now this questioun:
Nor nevermore shall see his lady.	Ne nevere mo ne shal his lady see.
For evermore, out of that country,	For everemo, as out of that contree,
And Arcite is exiled on threat of losing his head	And Arcite is exiled upon his heed
Is damned perpetually to prison,	Perpetuelly is dampned to prisoun,
For, briefly to say (it), this Palamon	For, shortly for to seyn, this Palamoun
I know not which has the more woeful task.	I noot which hath the wofuller mester.
Both of the lover and the prisoner.	Bothe of the lovere and the prisoner.
Increase doubly the strong pains	Encressen double wise the peynes stronge
The summer passes, and the long nights	The somer passeth, and the nyghtes longe
And of Arcite forth I will tell you.	And of Arcita forth I wol yow telle.
And leave him to dwell in his prison still,	And lete hym in his prisoun stille dwelle,
Now will I cease (speaking of) of Palamon for a little while,	Now wol I stynte of Palamon a lite,
And Venus slays me on that other side	And Venus sleeth me on that oother syde
Of Thebes with its wide devastated walls;	Of Thebes with his waste walles wyde;
Who has destroyed well nigh all the blood	That hath destroyed wel ny al the blood
And also because of Juno, jealous and also mad,	And eek thurgh Juno, jalous and eek wood,
But I must be in prison because of Saturn,	But I moot been in prisoun thurgh Saturne,
Go at his liberty, and can go where he pleases.	Goon at his large, and where hym list may turne.
That has done mischief to many a true man,	That many a trewe man hath doon mescheef,
Alas, I see a serpent or a thief,	Allas, I se a serpent or a theef,
But well I know that great pain is in this world.	But wel I woot that in this world greet pyne ys.
Without doubt such is the case.	Withouten doute it may stonden so.
Though in this world he may have (had) care and woe.	Though in this world he have care and wo.
But man after his death must weep and lament,	But man after his deeth moot wepe and pleyne,
And when a beast is dead he has no pain;	And whan a beest is deed he hath no peyne;
Whereas a beast may fulfill all his desire.	Ther as a beest may al his lust fulfille.
For God's sake, to refrain from his desire,	For Goddes sake, to letten of his wille,
That man is bound to his duty,	That man is bounden to his observaunce,
And yet this increases all my suffering,	And yet encresseth this al my penaunce,
That torments guiltless innocence?	That giltelees tormenteth innocence?
And often times guiltless, indeed.	And ofte tymes giltelees, pardee.
And has sickness and great adversity,	And hath siknesse and greet adversitee,
And dwells also in prison and detention,	And dwelleth eek in prison and arreest,
For man is slain exactly like another beast,	For slayn is man right as another beest,
Than is the sheep that cowers in the sheepfold?	Than is the sheep that rouketh in the folde?
Why is mankind more obligated unto you	What is mankynde moore unto you holde
Your decision and your eternal decree,	Youre parlement and youre eterne graunt,
And write in the table of adamant (hardest of stones)	And writen in the table of atthamaunt
This world with binding of your eternal word,	This world with byndyng of youre word eterne,
The box tree or the ash dead and cold.	The boxtree or the asshen dede and colde.
So madly that he was to look upon like	So woodly that he lyk was to biholde
Within his breast, and seized him by the heart	Withinne his brest, and hente him by the herte
With that the fire of jealousy started up	Therwith the fyr of jalousie up sterte
That doubles all my torment and my woe."	That doubleth al my torment and my wo."
And also with pain that love gives me also,	And eek with peyne that love me yeveth also,
With all the woe that prison may give me,	With al the wo that prison may me yive,
For I must weep and wail, while I live,	For I moot wepe and wayle, whil I lyve,
More than is mine, who die here in a cage.	Moore than is myn, that sterve here in a cage.
Since thou art at thy liberty, free of prison,	Sith thou art at thy large, of prisoun free,
For, as by way of possibility,	For, as by wey of possibilitee,
For whom I must of necessity lose my life.	For whom that I moste nedes lese my lyf.
Thou mayest have her as lady and as wife	Thow mayst have hire to lady and to wyf
That by some chance or some treaty	That by som aventure or some tretee
And make a war so sharp on this city	And make a werre so sharp on this citee
Assemble all the folk of our family,	Assemblen alle the folk of oure kynrede,
Thou mayest, since thou hast wisdom and manhood,	Thou mayst, syn thou hast wisdom and manhede,
And thou care little about my woe.	And of my wo thow yevest litel charge.
Of all our strife, God knows, the profit is thine.	Of al oure strif, God woot, the fruyt is thyn.
"Alas," said he, "Arcite, cousin mine,	"Allas," quod he, "Arcita, cosyn myn,
Were wet from his bitter, salt tears.	Weren of his bittre, salte teeres wete.
The great fetters themselves on his shins	The pure fettres on his shynes grete
Resounds with his yowling and clamor.	Resouneth of his youlyng and clamour.
He makes such sorrow that the great tour	Swich sorwe he maketh that the grete tour
When he knew Arcite was gone,	Whan that he wiste Arcite was agon,
Upon that other side Palamon,	Upon that oother syde Palamon,
I am as good as dead; there is not any remedy."	I nam but deed; ther nys no remedye."
Whereas now I am exiled from my source of happiness.	Ther now I am exiled fro my wele.
Then I would have been in joy and perfect well-being,	Thanne hadde I been in joye and parfit heele,
That if I might escape from prison,	That if I myghte escapen from prisoun,
Who supposed and had a firm belief	That wende and hadde a greet opinioun
Thus can we all say, and especially I,	Thus may we seyen alle, and namely I,
But we go wrong very often, truly.	But we goon wrong ful often, trewely.
We seek eagerly after felicity,	We seken faste after felicitee,
And certainly, so we fare in this world;	And certes, in this world so faren we;
And to a drunk man the way is slippery.	And to a dronke man the wey is slider.
A drunk man knows well he has a house,	A dronke man woot wel he hath an hous,
We act like one who is drunk as a mouse.	We faren as he that dronke is as a mous.
We know not what thing we pray for here;	We witen nat what thing we preyen heere;
Infinite harms are in this matter.	Infinite harmes been in this mateere.
Who is slain in his house by members of his household.	That in his hous is of his meynee slayn.
And one man would happily (go) out of his prison,	And som man wolde out of his prisoun fayn,
Which is the cause of his murder or great sickness;	That cause is of his mordre or greet siknesse;
One man desires to have riches,	Som man desireth for to han richesse,
Much better than they can themselves imagine?	Wel bettre than they kan hemself devyse?
About the providence of God, or of Fortune,	On purveiaunce of God, or of Fortune,
"Alas, why do folk so commonly complain	"Allas, why pleynen folk so in commune
Farwell my life, my desire, and my gladness!	Farwel my lif, my lust, and my gladnesse!
Well ought I to die in despair and distress.	Wel oughte I sterve in wanhope and distresse.
That can help me or do comfort (to me) in this,	That may me helpe or doon confort in this,
Nor creature that is made of them,	Ne creature that of hem maked is,
That there is not earth, water, fire, nor air,	That ther nys erthe, water, fir, ne eir,
Of all grace, and in so great despair	Of alle grace, and in so greet dispeir
But I, who am exiled and barren	But I, that am exiled and bareyne
That by some chance, since Fortune is changeable,	That by som cas, syn Fortune is chaungeable,
And art a knight, a worthy and an able (one),	And art a knyght, a worthy and an able,
For it is possible, since thou hast her presence,	For possible is, syn thou hast hire presence,
That hast the sight of her, and I the absence.	That hast the sighte of hire, and I th'absence.
Well has Fortune turned the dice for thee,	Wel hath Fortune yturned thee the dys,
In prison? Certainly not, but in paradise!	In prison? Certes nay, but in paradys!
Very blissfully in prison thou can remain --	Ful blisfully in prison maistow dure --
"The victory of this adventure is thine.	"Thyn is the victorie of this aventure.
O dear cousin Palamon," said he,	O deere cosyn Palamon," quod he,
Though I never can deserve her grace,	Though that I nevere hir grace may deserve,
Only the sight of her whom I serve,	Oonly the sighte of hire whom that I serve,
Then would I have been in bliss and not in woe.	Thanne hadde I been in blisse and nat in wo.
Fettered in his prison evermore.	Yfetered in his prisoun everemo.
For else I would have remained with Theseus,	For elles hadde I dwelled with Theseus,
Alas, that ever I knew Perotheus!	Allas, that evere knew I Perotheus!
Not in purgatory, but in hell.	Noght in purgatorie, but in helle.
Now I am destined eternally to dwell	Now is me shape eternally to dwelle
Now my prison is worse than before;	Now is my prisoun worse than biforn;
To slay himself he secretly awaits (an opportunity).	To sleen hymself he waiteth prively.
He weeps, wails, cries piteously;	He wepeth, wayleth, crieth pitously;
He feels the death smite through his heart;	The deeth he feeleth thurgh his herte smyte;
How great a sorrow now suffers Arcite!	How greet a sorwe suffreth now Arcite!
Let him be ware! His neck lies as a pledge.	Lat hym be war! His nekke lith to wedde.
But (he) takes his leave, and homeward he sped.	But taketh his leve, and homward he him spedde.
There was no other remedy nor course of action;	Ther nas noon oother remedie ne reed;
That with a sword he should lose his head.	That with a swerd he sholde lese his heed.
And if he were caught, it was agreed thus,	And he were caught, it was acorded thus,
Ever in his life, by day or night, at any moment	Evere in his lif, by day or nyght, oo stounde
That if it so were that Arcite were found	That if so were that Arcite were yfounde
Between Theseus and this Arcite:	Bitwixen Theseus and hym Arcite:
This was the agreement, plainly to write,	This was the forward, pleynly for t'endite,
In such a manner as shall I tell you.	In swich a gyse as I you tellen shal.
Freely to go all over, wherever he wishes,	Frely to goon wher that hym liste over al,
Duke Theseus let him out of prison	Duc Theseus hym leet out of prisoun
Of Perotheus, without any ransom,	Of Perotheus, withouten any raunsoun,
And finally at request and prayer	And finally at requeste and preyere
Duke Perotheus loved well Arcite,	Duc Perotheus loved wel Arcite,
But of that story I do not desire to write.	But of that storie list me nat to write.
His friend went and sought him down in hell --	His felawe wente and soughte hym doun in helle --
That when one was dead, truly to tell,	That whan that oon was deed, soothly to telle,
So well they loved, as old books say,	So wel they lovede, as olde bookes sayn,
And he (Theseus) loved him as tenderly in turn.	And he loved hym als tendrely agayn.
For in this world he loved no man so (much),	For in this world he loved no man so,
And to amuse himself as he was accustomed to do;	And for to pleye as he was wont to do;
Had come to Athens to visit his friend,	Was come to Atthenes his felawe to visite,
Who was a friend to duke Theseus	That felawe was unto duc Theseus
A worthy duke that was called Perotheus,	A worthy duc that highte Perotheus,
To tell it to you as briefly as I can,	To telle it yow as shortly as I may,
But to the point. It happened on a day,	But to th'effect. It happed on a day,
If I had leisure to tell (it);	If that I hadde leyser for to seye;
Great and long was the strife between them two,	Greet was the strif and long bitwix hem tweye,
And each one of us take his chance."	And everich of us take his aventure."
Here in this prison we must endure,	Heere in this prisoun moote we endure,
And truly, dear brother, this is all.	And soothly, leeve brother, this is al.
Each man for himself, there is no other (way).	Ech man for hymself, ther is noon oother.
And therefore, at the king's court, my brother,	And therfore, at the kynges court, my brother,
And carried away the bone between them both.	And baar awey the boon bitwixe hem bothe.
There came a kite, while they were so angry,	Ther cam a kyte, whil that they were so wrothe,
They fought all day, and yet their share was nothing.	They foughte al day, and yet hir part was noon.
We strive as the hounds did for the bone;	We stryve as dide the houndes for the boon;
Perpetually; no ransom can help us.	Perpetuelly; us gayneth no raunsoun.
That thou and I are condemned to prison	That thou and I be dampned to prisoun
For well thou thyself knowest, truly,	For wel thou woost thyselven, verraily,
And also it is not likely all thy life	And eek it is nat likly al thy lyf
Whether she be maid, or widow, or else wife.	Al be she mayde, or wydwe, or elles wyf.
He can not flee (from) it, though he should be dead,	He may nat fleen it, thogh he sholde be deed,
A man must of necessity love, in spite of all he can do;	A man moot nedes love, maugree his heed;
Is broken every day for love in every way.	Is broken al day for love in ech degree.
And therefore positive (man-made) law and such decree	And therfore positif lawe and swich decree
Than may be given to any earthly man;	Than may be yeve to any erthely man;
Love is a greater law, by my skull,	Love is a gretter lawe, by my pan,
That `who shall give a lover any law?'	That `who shal yeve a lovere any lawe?'
I posit (this assumption): that thou lovedest her first;	I pose that thow lovedest hire biforn;
As to my cousin and my sworn brother.	As to my cosyn and my brother sworn.
For which I told thee my circumstance	For which I tolde thee myn aventure
And mine is love as to a creature;	And myn is love as to a creature;
Thine is a feeling of holiness,	Thyn is affeccioun of hoolynesse,
Whether she is a woman or goddess!	Wheither she be a womman or goddesse!
What wilt thou say? Thou knowest not yet now	What wiltow seyen? Thou woost nat yet now
As a mistress I loved her first before thou.	For paramour I loved hire first er thow.
And thou art false, I tell thee flatly,	And thou art fals, I telle thee outrely,
This Arcite full proudly spoke in return:	This Arcite ful proudly spak ageyn:
Or else thou art false, I dare well say."	Or elles artow fals, I dar wel seyn."
To help me, if it lay in thy power,	To helpen me, if it lay in thy myght,
For which thou art bound as a knight	For which thou art ybounden as a knyght
To further me, as I have told before.	To forthre me, as I have toold biforn.
As to my confidant and my sworn brother	As to my conseil and my brother sworn
I loved hire first, and told thee my woe	I loved hire first, and tolde thee my wo
Nay, certainly, false Arcite, thou shalt not (do) so.	Nay, certes, false Arcite, thow shalt nat so.
And ever shall until my heart dies.	And evere shal til that myn herte sterve.
And now thou wouldest falsely be busy preparing	And now thow woldest falsly been aboute
Thus thou art my trusted confidant, without doubt,	Thus artow of my conseil, out of doute,
I know right well, thou darest not deny it.	I woot right wel, thou darst it nat withseyn.
This was thy oath, and mine also, certainly;	This was thyn ooth, and myn also, certeyn;
In every case, as I shall help thee --	In every cas, as I shal forthren thee --
But rather thou shouldest truly help me	But that thou sholdest trewely forthren me
Nor in any other case, my dear brother,	Ne in noon oother cas, my leeve brother,
Neither of us in love (is) to hinder the other,	Neither of us in love to hyndre oother,
Until death shall part us two,	Til that the deeth departe shal us tweyne,
Sworn very sincerely, and each of us to the other,	Ysworn ful depe, and ech of us til oother,
To me, who am thy cousin and thy brother	To me, that am thy cosyn and thy brother
To be false, nor to be traitor	For to be fals, ne for to be traitour
"It would not be," said he, "any great honor to thee	"It nere," quod he, "to thee no greet honour
This Palamon did knit his two brows.	This Palamon gan knytte his browes tweye.
So help me God, I have no desire to play."	God helpe me so, me list ful yvele pleye."
"Nay," said Arcite, "in earnest, by my faith!	"Nay," quod Arcite, "in ernest, by my fey!
"Sayest thou this in earnest or in play?"	"Wheither seistow this in ernest or in pley?"
Angrily he looked and answered,	Dispitously he looked and answerde,
I am as good as dead; there is no more to say."	I nam but deed; ther nis namoore to seye."
So that I can at least see her,	That I may seen hire atte leeste weye,
And unless I have her mercy and her grace,	And but I have hir mercy and hir grace,
Of her who roams in the yonder place;	Of hire that rometh in the yonder place;
"The fresh beauty slays me suddenly	"The fresshe beautee sleeth me sodeynly
And with a sigh he said piteously,	And with a sigh he seyde pitously,
Arcite is hurt as much as he, or more.	Arcite is hurt as muche as he, or moore.
That, if Palamon was sorely wounded,	That, if that Palamon was wounded sore,
And with that sight her beauty hurt him so,	And with that sighte hir beautee hurte hym so,
And with that word Arcite did see	And with that word Arcite gan espye
Which is brought so low by tyranny."	That is so lowe ybroght by tirannye."
Have some compassion on our (noble) lineage	Of oure lynage have som compassioun,
By eternal decree to die in prison,	By eterne word to dyen in prisoun,
And if it be so that my destiny is shaped	And if so be my destynee be shapen
Help that we may escape out of this prison.	Out of this prisoun help that we may scapen.
Before me, sorrowful, wretched creature,	Bifore me, sorweful, wrecched creature,
Thus to transfigure yourself in this garden	Yow in this gardyn thus to transfigure
And said, "Venus, if it be thy will	And seyde, "Venus, if it be thy wil
But truly it is Venus, as I suppose."	But Venus is it soothly, as I gesse."
I know not whether she is woman or goddess,	I noot wher she be womman or goddesse,
Is cause of all my crying and my woe.	Is cause of al my criyng and my wo.
Yonder in the garden roaming to and fro	Yond in the gardyn romen to and fro
The fairness of that lady whom I see	The fairnesse of that lady that I see
Into my heart, so that it will be the death of me.	Into myn herte, that wol my bane be.
But I was hurt right now through my eye	But I was hurt right now thurghout myn ye
This prison did not cause me to cry out,	This prison caused me nat for to crye,
Thou hast a foolish conception.	Thow hast a veyn ymaginacioun.
This Palamon answered and said in reply,	This Palamon answerde and seyde agayn,
We must endure it; this is the short and plain."	We moste endure it; this is the short and playn."
So stood the heavens when we were born.	So stood the hevene whan that we were born.
Has given us this, although we had sworn it would not be;	Hath yeven us this, although we hadde it sworn;
Of Saturn, by some arrangement of the heavenly bodies,	Of Saturne, by som constellacioun,
Some wicked aspect or disposition	Som wikke aspect or disposicioun
Fortune has given us this adversity.	Fortune hath yeven us this adversitee.
Our imprisonment, for it may not be otherwise.	Oure prisoun, for it may noon oother be.
For the love of God, take all in patience	For Goddes love, taak al in pacience
Who art so pale and deadly to look upon?	That art so pale and deedly on to see?
And said, "My cousin, what ails thee,	And seyde, "Cosyn myn, what eyleth thee,
And with that cry Arcite immediately leaped up	And with that cry Arcite anon up sterte
As though he were stabbed unto the heart.	As though he stongen were unto the herte.
And with that he turned pale and cried, "A!"	And therwithal he bleynte and cride, "A!"
He cast his eye upon Emelye,	He cast his eye upon Emelya,
Of iron, great and square as any beam,	Of iren greet and square as any sparre,
That through a window, thickly set with many a bar	That thurgh a wyndow, thikke of many a barre
And so it happened, by chance or accident,	And so bifel, by aventure or cas,
And to himself lamenting his woe.	And to hymself compleynynge of his wo.
Goes in the chamber roaming to and fro	Goth in the chambre romynge to and fro
This sorrowful prisoner, this Palamon,	This sorweful prisoner, this Palamoun,
Was in her walk, and roamed up and down.	Was in hire walk, and romed up and doun.
Where this fresh Emelye the bright	Ther as this fresshe Emelye the shene
And also the garden, full of green branches,	And eek the gardyn, ful of braunches grene,
In which he saw all the noble city,	In which he al the noble citee seigh,
Had risen and roamed in a chamber on high,	Was risen and romed in a chambre an heigh,
As was his custom, by permission of his jailer,	As was his wone, by leve of his gayler,
The sun was bright and clear that morning,	Bright was the sonne and cleer that morwenynge,
Where this Emelye took her pleasure.	Ther as this Emelye hadde hir pleyynge.
Was just next to the garden wall	Was evene joynant to the gardyn wal
Of which I told yow and shall tell),	Of which I tolde yow and tellen shal),
(Where the knights were in prison	(Ther as the knyghtes weren in prisoun
Which was the main fortification of the castle	Which of the castel was the chief dongeoun
The great tower, that was so thick and strong,	The grete tour, that was so thikke and stroong,
And she sang (as) heavenly as an angel.	And as an aungel hevenysshly she soong.
To make an intricate garland for her head;	To make a subtil gerland for hire hede;
She walks up and down, and as she pleases	She walketh up and doun, and as hire liste
And in the garden, at the rising of the sun,	And in the gardyn, at the sonne upriste,
Behind her back, a yard long, I guess.	Bihynde hir bak, a yerde long, I gesse.
Her yellow hair was braided in a tress	Hir yelow heer was broyded in a tresse
She was gaily clothed, so to say:	Yclothed was she fressh, for to devyse:
To do honor to May, and to rise.	To doon honour to May, and for to ryse.
This made Emelye remember	This maked Emelye have remembraunce
And says "Arise, and do thy observance."	And seith "Arys, and do thyn observaunce."
And makes it out of its sleep to awake suddenly,	And maketh it out of his slep to sterte,
For May will have no laziness at night.	For May wole have no slogardie anyght.
She was arisen and all ready prepared,	She was arisen and al redy dight,
Before it was day, as was her custom to do,	Er it were day, as was hir wone to do,
I do not know which was the finer of them two --	I noot which was the fyner of hem two --
For her hue vied with color of the rose,	For with the rose colour stroof hire hewe,
And fresher than the May with new flowers --	And fressher than the May with floures newe --
Than is the lily upon its green stalk,	Than is the lylie upon his stalke grene,
That Emelye, who was fairer to be seen	That Emelye, that fairer was to sene
Until it befell once, in a morning of May,	Till it fil ones, in a morwe of May,
For evermore (remain); no gold can ransom them.	For everemoore; ther may no gold hem quite.
This Palamon and his fellow Arcite	This Palamon and his felawe Arcite
And in a tower, in anguish and in woe,	And in a tour, in angwissh and in wo,
For the duration of his life; what more words are needed?	Terme of his lyf; what nedeth wordes mo?
And there he lives in joy and in honor	And ther he lyveth in joye and in honour
As a conqueror crowned with laurel;	With laurer crowned as a conquerour;
He took his army, and home he rides straightway	He took his hoost, and hoom he rit anon
And when this worthy duke has thus done,	And whan this worthy duc hath thus ydon,
Perpetually -- he would not (accept) any ransom.	Perpetuelly -- he nolde no raunsoun.
Of Theseus; and he very soon sent them	Of Theseus; and he ful soone hem sente
And have carried them softy unto the tent	And han hem caried softe unto the tente
The scavengers have pulled them out of the heap,	Out of the taas the pilours han hem torn,
Of Thebes, and born of two sisters.	Of Thebes, and of sustren two yborn.
As they that were of the royal blood	As they that weren of the blood roial
The heralds best knew them in particular	The heraudes knewe hem best in special
But by their coats of arms and by their equipment	But by hir cote-armures and by hir gere
They were not fully alive, nor fully dead,	Nat fully quyke, ne fully dede they were,
And that other knight was called Palamon.	And that oother knyght highte Palamon.
Both with the same coat of arms, very richly wrought,	Bothe in oon armes, wroght ful richely,
Two young knights lying side by side,	Two yonge knyghtes liggynge by and by,
Pierced through with many a grievous bloody wound,	Thurgh-girt with many a grevous blody wounde,

And did with all the country as he pleased.	And dide with al the contree as hym leste.

That Theseus, the noble conqueror,	That Theseus, the noble conquerour,
Of the bodies, and the great honor	Of the bodies, and the grete honour
That the ladies made at the burning	That the ladyes made at the brennynge
The great clamor and the lamentation	The grete clamour and the waymentynge

The bones of their husbands who were slain,	The bones of hir freendes that were slayn,
And he gave back to the ladies	And to the ladyes he restored agayn
And tore down both wall and beam and rafter;	And rente adoun bothe wall and sparre and rafter;
And by assault he won the city afterwards,	And by assaut he wan the citee after,
In open battle, and put the army to flight;	In pleyn bataille, and putte the folk to flyght;
He fought, and slew him boldly as a knight	He faught, and slough hym manly as a knyght
With Creon, who was king of Thebes,	With Creon, which that was of Thebes kyng,

And forth he rides; there is no more to tell.	And forth he rit; ther is namoore to telle.

Nor take his ease fully half a day,	Ne take his ese fully half a day,
He would not walk nor ride any nearer to Athens,	No neer Atthenes wolde he go ne ride,
Toward Thebes, and all his army beside (him).	To Thebes-ward, and al his hoost biside.

As one who had very well deserved his death.	As he that hadde his deeth ful wel deserved.

To avenge them upon the tyrant Creon	Upon the tiraunt Creon hem to wreke

And how Ypolita was besieged,	And how asseged was Ypolita,
Between Athenians and Amazons;	Bitwixen Atthenes and Amazones;
And of the great battle at that time	And of the grete bataille for the nones
By Theseus and by his chivalry;	By Theseus and by his chivalrye;

What with his wisdom and his chivalry,	What with his wysdom and his chivalrie,
Very many a powerful country had he won;	Ful many a riche contree hadde he wonne;
And in his time such a conqueror	And in his tyme swich a conquerour

There was a duke who was called Theseus;	Ther was a duc that highte Theseus;

My son, beware, and be no author new	My sone, be war, and be noon auctour newe
A tale of which he is now very sorry.	A tale of which he is now yvele apayd.
Though he repent, or be ever so unwilling (it be known).	Though hym repente, or be hym nevere so looth.
Thing that is said is said, and forth it goes,	Thyng that is seyd is seyd, and forth it gooth,
He can by no way call his word back.	He may by no wey clepe his word agayn.
But he who has spoken evil, I dare well say,	But he that hath mysseyd, I dar wel sayn,
Thou need not dread to be betrayed;	Thee thar nat drede for to be biwreyd;
My son, if thou no wicked word hast said,	My sone, if thou no wikked word hast seyd,
That little tale-telling causes much rest.	That litel janglyng causeth muchel reste.
The Fleming says, and learn it if thou please,	The Flemyng seith, and lerne it if thee leste,
A tale-teller speak of perilous matter.	A janglere speke of perilous mateere.
My son, speak not, but with thy head thou nod.	My sone, spek nat, but with thyn heed thou bekke.
Read David in his psalms; read Seneca.	Reed David in his psalmes; reed Senekke.

A tale-teller is to God abominable.	A jangler is to God abhomynable.
A tongue cuts friendship all in two.	A tonge kutteth freendshipe al a-two.
An arm in two, my dear son, just so	An arm a-two, my deere sone, right so
Right as a sword cuts and carves	Right as a swerd forkutteth and forkerveth
Knowest thou what a rash tongue serves for?	Wostow wherof a rakel tonge serveth?
In much speech sin is not lacking.	In muchel speche synne wanteth naught.
Where less speaking had well enough sufficed,	Ther lasse spekyng hadde ynough suffised,
My son, of much ill-considered speaking,	My sone, of muchel spekyng yvele avysed,
Thus learn children when they are young.	Thus lerne children whan that they been yonge.
Is to restrain and guard well thy tongue;	Is to restreyne and kepe wel thy tonge;
The first virtue, son, if thou will learn,	The firste vertu, sone, if thou wolt leere,
To speak of God, in honor and prayer.	To speke of God, in honour and preyere.
At all times, but when thou make an effort	At alle tymes, but whan thou doost thy peyne
My son, thy tongue thou should restrain	My sone, thy tonge sholdestow restreyne
Is no man harmed, to speak generally.	Is no man shent, to speke generally.
Has many a man been ruined, as clerks teach,	Hath many a man been spilt, as clerkes teche,
My son, very often, for too much speech	My sone, ful ofte, for to muche speche
So that man should think about what he may speak.	For man sholde hym avyse what he speeke.
Walled a tongue with teeth and lips also,	Walled a tonge with teeth and lippes eke,
My son, God of his endless goodness	My sone, God of his endelees goodnesse
My son, from a fiend men can bless themselves.	My sone, from a feend men may hem blesse.
A wicked tongue is worse than a fiend;	A wikked tonge is worse than a feend;
My son, hold well thy tongue, and keep thy friend.	My sone, keep wel thy tonge, and keep thy freend.
"My son, think on the crow, in God's name!	"My sone, thenk on the crowe, a Goddes name!

How another man has copulated with his wife;	How that another man hath dight his wyf;
And tell never any man in your life	Ne telleth nevere no man in youre lyf

Gentlemen, by this example I you pray,	Lordynges, by this ensample I yow preye,
And because of this case all crows are black.	And for this caas been alle crowes blake.
And also his speech, and out the door slung him	And eek his speche, and out at dore hym slong
And made him black, and took away all his song,	And made hym blak, and refte hym al his song,
And pulled out his white feathers every one,	And pulled his white fetheres everychon,
And to the crow he rushed, and that right away,	And to the crowe he stirte, and that anon,
As a sign that through thee my wife is slain."	In tokenynge that thurgh thee my wyf is slayn."
But ever cry in anticipation of tempest and rain,	But evere crie agayn tempest and rayn,
Nor never sweet noise shall you make,	Ne nevere sweete noyse shul ye make,
Thou and thy offspring ever shall be black,	Thou and thyn ofspryng evere shul be blake,
Thus shall men on a traitor be avenged;	Thus shal men on a traytour been awreke;
And also thy white feathers every one,	And eek thy white fetheres everichon,
Now shalt thou, false thief, give up thy song,	Now shaltow, false theef, thy song forgon,
Thou once sang like a nightingale;	Thou songe whilom lyk a nyghtyngale;
"I will pay thee back immediately (for) thy false tale.	"I wol thee quite anon thy false tale.
And to the crow, "O false thief!" said he,	And to the crowe, "O false theef!" seyde he,
Alas! For sorrow I will myself slay!"	Allas! For sorwe I wol myselven slee!"
Completely undone, and brought them in the mire.	Fully fordoon, and broght hem in the mire.
Alas, a thousand folk has rash anger	Allas, a thousand folk hath rakel ire
Upon your anger caused by suspicion.	Upon youre ire for suspecion.
And be advised well and soberly	And beeth avysed wel and sobrely
Smite not too soon, before you know why,	Smyt nat to soone, er that ye witen why,
Do not believe any thing without strong evidence.	Ne trowe no thyng withouten strong witnesse.
O every man, beware of rashness!	O every man, be war of rakelnesse!
Where was thy wit and thy discretion?	Where was thy wit and thy discrecion?
O mistrust, full of false suspicion,	O wantrust, ful of fals suspecion,
That recklessly smites the guiltless!	That unavysed smyteth gilteles!
O troubled wit, O reckless anger,	O trouble wit, O ire recchelees,
O rash hand, to do so foul a crime!	O rakel hand, to doon so foule amys!
Now liest thou dead, with face pale of hue,	Now listow deed, with face pale of hewe,
Who were to me so stable and also so true,	That were to me so sad and eek so trewe,
O dear wife! O gem of delight!	O deere wyf! O gemme of lustiheed!
Alas, that I was wrought! Why was I not dead?	Allas, that I was wroght! Why nere I deed?
Thou hast me brought to my ruin;	Thou hast me broght to my confusioun;
"Traitor," said he, "with tongue of scorpion,	"Traitour," quod he, "with tonge of scorpioun,
And after that thus spoke he to the crow:	And after that thus spak he to the crowe:
And also he broke his arrows and his bow,	And eek he brak his arwes and his bowe,
Both harp, and lute, and cither, and psaltery;	Bothe harpe, and lute, and gyterne, and sautrie;
This is the substance of it; there is no more to say;	This is th' effect; ther is namoore to sayn;
And in his ire his wife then has he slain.	And in his ire his wyf thanne hath he slayn.
His bow he bent, and set therein an arrow,	His bowe he bente, and sette therinne a flo,
And thought his sorrowful heart would break in two.	And thoughte his sorweful herte brast atwo.
This Phoebus began to turn away,	This Phebus gan aweyward for to wryen,
And told him repeatedly he saw it with his eyes.	And tolde hym ofte he saugh it with his yen.
To his great shame and to his great dishonor,	Hym to greet shame and to greet vileynye,
How his wife had done her lechery,	How that his wyf had doon hire lecherye,
By clear evidence and by bold words,	By sadde tokenes and by wordes bolde,
For on thy bed I saw him copulate with thy wife."	For on thy bed thy wyf I saugh hym swyve."
The value of a gnat, as I may thrive!	The montance of a gnat, so moote I thryve!
Not worth, compared to thee,	Noght worth to thee, as in comparisoun,
By one of little reputation,	With oon of litel reputacioun,
For all thy watching, thou hast been tricked	For al thy waityng, blered is thyn ye
For all thy song and all thy music,	For al thy song and al thy mynstralcye,
For all thy beauty and thy nobility,	For al thy beautee and thy gentilesse,

"By God," said he, "I sing not amiss.	"By God," quod he, "I synge nat amys.
That to my heart it was a rejoicing	That to myn herte it was a rejoysynge
Were thou not accustomed so merrily to sing	Ne were thow wont so myrily to synge
"What, bird?" said Phoebus. "What song singest thou?	"What, bryd?" quod Phebus. "What song syngestow?
This crow sang "Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!"	This crowe sang "Cokkow! Cokkow! Cokkow!"
And when home was come Phoebus, the lord,	And whan that hoom was come Phebus, the lord,
Beheld their work, and said never a word.	Biheeld hire werk, and seyde never a word.
The white crow, that hanged always in the cage,	The white crowe, that heeng ay in the cage,
Right away they satisfied all their reckless lust.	Anon they wroghten al hire lust volage.
When Phoebus wife had sent for her leman,	Whan Phebus wyf had sent for hir lemman,
I will tell nothing of texts, never a bit;	I wol noght telle of textes never a deel;
But because I am not a learned man,	But for I am a man noght textueel,
Men call him an outlaw or a thief.	Men clepen hym an outlawe or a theef.
Nor bring a country to such great mischief,	Ne brynge a contree to so greet mescheef,
And can not do as much harm as he,	And may nat doon so greet an harm as he,
And because the outlaw has but a small group of followers,	And for the outlawe hath but smal meynee,
Lo, therefore is he called a captain;	Lo, therfore is he cleped a capitayn;
And burn house and home, and level everything,	And brennen hous and hoom, and make al playn,
By the size of his army to slay downright,	By force of meynee for to sleen dounright,
To Alexander was told this sentence,	To Alisaundre was toold this sentence,
The same I say: there is no difference.	The same I seye: ther is no difference.
And an outlaw or an arrant thief,	And an outlawe or a theef erraunt,
Right so between an usurping tyrant	Right so bitwixe a titlelees tiraunt
Men lay that one as low as lies that other.	Men leyn that oon as lowe as lith that oother.
And, God it knows, my own dear brother,	And, God it woot, myn owene deere brother,
She shall be called his wench or his sweetie.	She shal be cleped his wenche or his lemman.
And because that other is a poor woman,	And for that oother is a povre womman,
She shall be called his lady, as in love;	She shal be cleped his lady, as in love;
If it so be they work both amiss --	If it so be they werke bothe amys --
And a poor wench, other than this --	And a povre wenche, oother than this --
If of her body dishonest she bee,	If of hir body dishonest she bee,
Between a wife that is of high degree,	Bitwixe a wyf that is of heigh degree,
There is no difference, truly,	Ther nys no difference, trewely,
I am an unlearned man, right thus say I:	I am a boystous man, right thus seye I:
The word must be cousin to the deed.	The word moot cosyn be to the werkyng.
If men shall tell a thing properly,	If men shal telle proprely a thyng,
The word must by necessity accord with the deed.	The word moot nede accorde with the dede.
Forgive it me, and that I you beseech.	Foryeveth it me, and that I yow biseche.
Her sweetheart? Certes, this is a knavish speech!	Hir lemman? Certes, this is a knavyssh speche!
His wife immediately has for her sweetheart sent.	His wyf anon hath for hir lemman sent.
And so befell, when Phoebus was absent,	And so bifel, whan Phebus was absent,
Of which there comes much harm and woe.	Of which ther cometh muchel harm and wo.
The more harm is, it happens often so,	The moore harm is, it happeth ofte so,
Worth nothing in comparison to Phoebus.	Nat worth to Phebus in comparisoun.
A man of little reputation,	A man of litel reputacioun,
For under him another had she,	For under hym another hadde shee,
This Phoebus, who thought upon no guile,	This Phebus, which that thoghte upon no gile,
That is consonant with virtue for any length of time.	That sowneth into vertu any while.
That we can not take pleasure in anything	That we ne konne in nothyng han plesaunce
Flesh is so fond of novelty, curses on it,	Flessh is so newefangel, with meschaunce,
Nor never so true, nor so gracious.	Ne never so trewe, ne so debonaire.
Than on their wives, be they never so fair,	Than on hire wyves, be they never so faire,
On lower things to perform their delight	On lower thyng to parfourne hire delit
For men have ever a lecherous appetite	For men han evere a likerous appetit
That are untrue, and nothing about women.	That been untrewe, and nothyng by wommen.
In time when she lusts to have a mate.	In tyme whan hir lust to han a make.
Or least of reputation, will she take,	Or leest of reputacioun, wol she take,
The most crude wolf that she can find,	The lewedeste wolf that she may fynde,
A she-wolf has also an evil nature.	A she-wolf hath also a vileyns kynde.
And appetite drives away discretion.	And appetit fleemeth discrecioun.
Lo, here has lust his domination,	Lo, heere hath lust his dominacioun,
Such appetite has he to eat a mouse.	Swich appetit hath he to ete a mous.
And every dainty that is in that house,	And every deyntee that is in that hous,
Right then he refuses milk and meat and all,	Anon he weyveth milk and flessh and al,
And tender meat, and make his couch of silk,	And tendre flessh, and make his couche of silk,
Let's take a cat, and foster him well with milk	Lat take a cat, and fostre hym wel with milk
His liberty this bird desires always.	His libertee this brid desireth ay.
To escape out of his cage, if he can.	To escape out of his cage, yif he may.
For ever this bird will work diligently	For evere this brid wol doon his bisynesse
Go eat worms and such wretched food.	Goon ete wormes and swich wrecchednesse.
Rather in a forest that is rude and cold	Levere in a forest that is rude and coold
Yet would this bird, by twenty thousand times,	Yet hath this brid, by twenty thousand foold,
Although his cage of gold be never so gay,	Although his cage of gold be never so gay,
Of all dainties that thou can imagine,	Of alle deyntees that thou kanst bithynke,
To foster it tenderly with food and drink	To fostre it tendrely with mete and drynke
And give all thy attention and take thy pains	And do al thyn entente and thy corage
Take any bird, and put it in a cage,	Taak any bryd, and put it in a cage,
Has naturally set in a creature.	Hath natureelly set in a creature.
And restrain a thing which nature	As to destreyne a thyng which that nature
But God knows it, there can no man embrace	But God it woot, ther may no man embrace
That no man should have put him out of her grace.	That no man sholde han put hym from hir grace.
And for his manly qualities and his behavior,	And for his manhede and his governaunce,
This worthy Phoebus does all that he can	This worthy Phebus dooth al that he kan
But now to purpose, as I first began:	But now to purpos, as I first bigan:
Thus wrote old clerks in their time.	Thus writen olde clerkes in hir lyves.
To waste labor guarding wives:	To spille labour for to kepe wyves:
This hold I for a real act of folly,	This holde I for a verray nycetee,
To keep a shrew, for it will not be.	To kepe a shrewe, for it wol nat bee.
And truly the labor is in vain	And trewely the labour is in vayn
Should not be constantly watched, certainly;	Sholde nat been kept in noon awayt, certayn;
A good wife, who is clean of deed and thought,	A good wyf, that is clene of werk and thoght,
And so is every person in such a situation;	And so is every wight in swich degree;
For he was loath to be tricked,	For hym were looth byjaped for to be,
Jealous he was, and would eagerly have kept her.	Jalous he was, and wolde have kept hire fayn.
Save only, if I shall say the truth,	Save oonly, if the sothe that I shal sayn,
To please her and do her reverence,	Hir for to plese and doon hire reverence,
And night and day did ever his efforts	And nyght and day dide evere his diligence
Whom he loved more than his life,	Which that he lovede moore than his lyf,
Now had this Phoebus in his house a woman	Now hadde this Phebus in his hous a wyf
Sing so wonderfully merrily and well.	Syngen so wonder myrily and weel.
Therewith in all this world no nightingale	Therwith in al this world no nyghtyngale
He could, when he should tell a tale.	He koude, whan he sholde telle a tale.
And imitate the speech of every man	And countrefete the speche of every man
White was this crow as is a snow-white swan,	Whit was this crowe as is a snow-whit swan,
And taught it to speak, as men teach a jay.	And taughte it speken, as men teche a jay.
Which in a cage he fostered many a day,	Which in a cage he fostred many a day,
Now had this Phoebus in his house a crow	Now hadde this Phebus in his hous a crowe
Was accustomed to bear in his hand a bow.	Was wont to beren in his hand a bowe.
Over Phitoun, as tells us the story,	Of Phitoun, so as telleth us the storie,
As well in generosity as in chivalry,	As wel in fredom as in chivalrie,
This Phoebus, which was the flower of knighthood,	This Phebus, that was flour of bachilrie,
Of honor, and of perfect worthiness.	Of honour, and of parfit worthynesse.
He was therewith filled full of nobility,	He was therwith fulfild of gentillesse,
For in this world was no one so handsome alive.	For in this world was noon so faire on-lyve.
What needs it his features to describe?	What nedeth it his fetures to discryve?
That is or was since the world began.	That is or was sith that the world bigan.
Thereto he was the best looking man	Therto he was the semelieste man
Could never sing half so well as he.	Koude nevere syngen half so wel as hee.
Certainly the king of Thebes, Amphioun,	Certes the kyng of Thebes, Amphioun,
To hear of his clear voice the sound.	To heeren of his cleere voys the soun.
And sing so that it was a pleasure	And syngen that it was a melodie
He could play on every minstrelsy,	Pleyen he koude on every mynstralcie,
He wrought with his bow, as men may read.	He with his bowe wroghte, as men may rede.
And many another noble worthy deed	And many another noble worthy dede
Sleeping in the sun upon a day;	Slepynge agayn the sonne upon a day;
He slew Phitoun, the serpent, as he lay	He slow Phitoun, the serpent, as he lay
In all this world, and also the best archer.	In al this world, and eek the beste archer.
As old books make mention,	As olde bookes maken mencioun,
When Phoebus dwelled down here in this earth,	Whan Phebus dwelled heere in this erthe adoun,
Here begins the Manciple's Tale of the Crow.	Heere bigynneth the Maunciples Tale of the Crowe.
"Well, sir," said he, "now hearken what I say."	"Wel, sire," quod he, "now herkneth what I seye."
Tell on thy tale, Manciple, I thee pray."	Telle on thy tale, Manciple, I thee preye."
Of that matter you get no more of me.	Of that mateere ye gete namoore of me.
Worship and thanks be to thy deity!	Worshipe and thank be to thy deitee!
Who so can turn earnest into game!	That so kanst turnen ernest into game!
"O Bacchus, blessed be thy name,	"O Bacus, yblessed be thy name,
For that will turn rancor and strife	For that wol turne rancour and disese
Wherever we go, to carry good drink with us;	Where that we goon, good drynke with us carie;
And said, "I see well it is necessary,	And seyde, "I se wel it is necessarie,
Then began our Host to laugh wonderfully loud,	Thanne gan oure Hoost to laughen wonder loude,
And thanked him in such a way as he could.	And thanked hym in swich wise as he koude.
And of that drink the Cook was wonderfully pleased,	And of that drynke the Cook was wonder fayn,
To the Manciple he gave the gourd again;	To the Manciple he took the gourde agayn;
And when he had blown in this horn,	And whan he hadde pouped in this horn,
Why did he need that? He drank enough before.	What neded hym? He drank ynough biforn.
And certainly, to tell it as it was,	And certeynly, to tellen as it was,
Upon pain of death, he will not say me nay."	Up peyne of deeth, he wol nat seye me nay."
This Cook shall drink thereof, if I may.	This Cook shal drynke therof, if I may.
And right away you shall see a good joke.	And right anon ye shul seen a good jape.
A draught of wine, yes, of a ripe grape,	A draghte of wyn, ye, of a ripe grape,
And do you know what? I have here in a gourd	And wite ye what? I have heer in a gourde
That which I spoke, I said it in my joking.	That that I spak, I seyde it in my bourde.
I will not anger him, as I may thrive!	I wol nat wratthen hym, also moot I thryve!
That he rides on, than he should strive with me.	Which he rit on, than he sholde with me stryve.
In that way he could easily bring me into the trap.	So myghte he lightly brynge me in the snare.
"No," said the Manciple, "that would be a great mischief!	"No," quod the Manciple, "that were a greet mescheef!
That may not be honest, if it comes to proof."	That were nat honest, if it cam to preef."
As for to find fault with thy accounts,	As for to pynchen at thy rekenynges,
I mean, he would speak of small things,	I meene, he speke wole of smale thynges,
Recall thee and bring thee to the lure (like a hawk);	Reclayme thee and brynge thee to lure;
Another day he would, perhaps,	Another day he wole, peraventure,
Thus openly to reprove him of his vice.	Thus openly repreve hym of his vice.
"But yet, Manciple, in faith thou art too foolish,	"But yet, Manciple, in feith thou art to nyce,
In lifting up his heavy drunken body.	In liftyng up his hevy dronken cors.
Then shall we all have enough to do	Thanne shal we alle have ynogh to doone
And if he fall from his horse again,	And if he falle from his capul eftsoone,
To keep him and his horse out of the mud;	To kepen hym and his capul out of the slough;
"He has also more than enough to do	"He hath also to do moore than ynough
And sneezes fast, and also he has a head cold.	And fneseth faste, and eek he hath the pose.
That he has drunk, he speaks in his nose,	That he hath dronke, he speketh in his nose,
For, were it wine or old or new ale	For, were it wyn or oold or moysty ale
I believe he would tell his tale badly.	I trowe he lewedly wolde telle his tale.
"Because drink has domination	"By cause drynke hath dominacioun
And to the Manciple then spoke our Host:	And to the Manciple thanne spak oure Hoost:
So unwieldy was this sorry enfeebled soul.	So unweeldy was this sory palled goost.
To lift him up, and much care and woe,	To lifte hym up, and muchel care and wo,
There was great shoving both to and fro	Ther was greet showvyng bothe to and fro
And before he was again in his saddle,	And er that he agayn were in his sadel,
Alas, he had not kept himself by his ladle (i.e., stayed home)!	Allas, he nadde holde hym by his ladel!
This was a fine feat of horsemanship by a cook!	This was a fair chyvachee of a cook!
Where he lay, until men lifted him up.	Where as he lay, til that men hym up took.
And on the Manciple he began to shake his head fast	And on the Manciple he gan nodde faste
And with this speech the Cook became angry and enraged,	And with this speche the Cook wax wrooth and wraw,
And that is when men play with a straw."	And that is whan men pleyen with a straw."
I believe that you have drunk until you act like an ape,	I trowe that ye dronken han wyn ape,

Ah, take heed, sirs, of this lusty man.	A, taketh heede, sires, of this lusty man.
Fie, stinking swine! Fie, may foul fortune thee befall!	Fy, stynkyng swyn! Fy, foule moote thee falle!
Thy cursed breath would infect us all.	Thy cursed breeth infecte wole us alle.
Keep thy mouth closed, man, by thy father's kin!	Hoold cloos thy mouth, man, by thy fader kyn!
As though he would swallow us right away.	As though he wolde swolwe us anonright.
See how he yawns, lo, this drunken fellow,	See how he ganeth, lo, this dronken wight,
By me, certainly, thou shalt not be deceived.	Of me, certeyn, thou shalt nat been yglosed.
That shows well thou art not in good health.	That sheweth wel thou art nat wel disposed.
And, well I know, thy breath full sourly stinks:	And, wel I woot, thy breeth ful soure stynketh:
Thy eyes are dazed also, as it seems to me,	Thyne eyen daswen eek, as that me thynketh,
For, in good faith, thy visage is full pale,	For, in good feith, thy visage is ful pale,
I will for now excuse thee of thy tale.	I wol as now excuse thee of thy tale.

Said to our Host, "God bless my soul,	Seyde to oure Hoost, "So God my soule blesse,

So that thou can not hold up thy head?"	So that thow mayst nat holden up thyn heed?"
Hast thou had fleas all night, or art thou drunk?	Hastow had fleen al nyght, or artow dronke?

Fallen in distress and in misfortune.	Falle in disese and in mysaventure.
When he saw so good a creature	Whan he saugh so benigne a creature
The king's heart for pity trembled,	The kynges herte of pitee gan agryse,
As before this you have heard tell.	As heer-biforn that ye han herd devyse.
That in a ship was found this Custance,	That in a ship was founden this Custance,
And also the time, and where, and in what manner	And eek the tyme, and where, and in what wise
For sheer woe her wit was all away.	For verray wo hir wit was al aweye.
By Lady Custance. Alas, what could she say?	By Dame Custance. Allas, what myghte she seye?
And in the bed the bloody knife he found	And in the bed the blody knyf he fond
For which full often he wept and wrung his hands,	For which ful ofte he weep and wroong his hond,
And saw his wife mercilessly slain,	And saugh his wyf despitously yslayn,
And also Alla, who was king of that land,	And eek Alla, that kyng was of that lond,
Soon after, this constable comes home again,	Soone after cometh this constable hoom agayn,
And went his way, may God give him misfortune!	And wente his wey, ther God yeve hym meschance!
And laid the bloody knife by Lady Custance,	And leyde the blody knyf by dame Custance,
Very quietly has gone to the bed,	Al softely is to the bed ygo,
This knight, through Satan's temptations,	This knyght, thurgh Sathanas temptaciouns,
Sleeps Custance, and Hermengild also.	Slepeth Custance, and Hermengyld also.
Weary, exhausted because of her prayers,	Wery, forwaked in hire orisouns,
In Hermengild's bedroom, while she slept.	In Hermengyldes chambre, whil she slepte.
And secretly one night he crept	And pryvely upon a nyght he crepte
He waits until the constable was away,	He wayteth whan the constable was aweye,
To make her in a shameful death to die.	To maken hire on shameful deeth to deye.
And for malice he plotted in his mind	And for despit he compassed in his thoght
He woos her, but it avails not;	He woweth hire, but it availleth noght;
Unless he might once have his will of her.	But he of hire myghte ones have his wille.
That truly he thought he should die,	That verraily hym thoughte he sholde spille,
Love her so passionately, by foul desire,	Love hire so hoote, of foul affeccioun,
And made a young knight that dwelt in that town	And made a yong knyght that dwelte in that toun
And considered right away how he might repay her,	And caste anon how he myghte quite hir while,
Saw of Custance all her perfection,	Saugh of Custance al hire perfeccioun,
Satan, that ever waits (for a chance) to trick us,	Sathan, that evere us waiteth to bigile,
But I will turn again to my subject.	But turne I wole agayn to my mateere.
Who was full wise, and worthy of his hand (a mighty warrior)	That was ful wys, and worthy of his hond
Under Alla, king of all Northumberland,	Under Alla, kyng of al Northhumbrelond,
But kept it securely many a winter's space of time	But kepte it strongly many a wyntres space
Of which I speak, where he Custance found,	Of which I speke, ther he Custance fond,
This constable was in no way lord of this place	This constable was nothyng lord of this place
Converts, and made him believe in Christ.	Converteth, and on Crist made hym bileve.
That she the constable, before it was evening,	That she the constable, er that it was eve
And so completely she did our religion explain	And so ferforth she gan oure lay declare
That helps folk out of the fiend's snare."	That helpeth folk out of the feendes snare."
And said, "What does all this business mean?"	And seyde, "What amounteth al this fare?"
The constable grew troubled at that sight,	The constable weex abasshed of that sight,
The will of Christ, as daughter of his church.	The wyl of Crist, as doghter of his chirche.
Until Custance made her bold, and told her to work	Til Custance made hire boold, and bad hire wirche
Would have slain her for Jesus Christ's love,	Wolde hire for Jhesu Cristes love han slayn,
Lest that her husband, shortly to say,	Lest that hir housbonde, shortly for to sayn,
This lady grew afraid of these words,	This lady weex affrayed of the soun,
"Dame Hermengild, give me my sight again!"	"Dame Hermengyld, yif me my sighte agayn!"
"In the name of Christ," cried this blind Briton,	"In name of Crist," cride this blinde Britoun,
And in their walk this blind man they met,	And in hir walk this blynde man they mette,
To amuse themselves and to roam to and fro,	To pleyen and to romen to and fro,
Toward the sea an eighth of a mile or two,	Toward the see a furlong wey or two,
And Custance have taken the direct route	And Custance han ytake the righte way
For which the constable and his wife also	For which the constable and his wyf also
Bright was the sun in that summer's day,	Bright was the sonne as in that someres day,
With which men see, after they have become blind.	With whiche men seen, after that they ben blynde.
Unless it were with those eyes of his mind	But it were with thilke eyen of his mynde
The one of them was blind and could not see,	That oon of hem was blynd and myghte nat see,
Honored Christ and deceived the heathen folk,	Honoured Crist and hethen folk bigiled,
That there were not some that in their secrecy	That ther nere somme that in hir privetee
But yet Christian Britons were not so (completely) exiled	But yet nere Cristene Britons so exiled
There was their refuge at that time.	Ther was hir refut for the meene while.
Of old Britons dwelling in this isle;	Of olde Britons dwellynge in this ile;
To Wales fled the Christian people	To Walys fledde the Cristyanytee
The coastal regions of the north, by land and sea.	The plages of the north, by land and see.
Because of pagans, that conquered all about	Thurgh payens, that conquereden al aboute
All Christian folk have fled from that country	Alle Cristen folk been fled fro that contree
Dame Hermengild, wife of the constable of that place.	Dame Hermengyld, constablesse of that place.
Until Jesus has converted through his grace	Til Jhesu hath converted thurgh his grace
In prayers, with many a bitter tear,	In orisons, with many a bitter teere,
And Custance has so long lived there,	And Custance hath so longe sojourned there,
But Hermengild loved her as much as her life,	But Hermengyld loved hire right as hir lyf,
Were pagans, and (so was) that country everywhere;	Were payens, and that contree everywhere;
This constable and Lady Hermengild, his wife,	This constable and dame Hermengyld, his wyf,
That all who look in her face love her.	That alle hir loven that looken in hir face.
To serve and please every one in that place	To serve and plesen everich in that place
And also his wife, that they weep for pity.	And eek his wyf, that they wepen for routhe.
The constable has for her such great pity,	The constable hath of hire so greet pitee,
That she lost her memory, by her pledged word (she swore).	That she forgat hir mynde, by hir trouthe.
She said she was so bewildered in the sea	She seyde she was so mazed in the see
For anything, though she should die.	For foul ne fair, thogh that she sholde deye.
But who she was she would tell no man,	But what she was she wolde no man seye,
She kneels down and gives thanks for what God has sent;	She kneleth doun and thanketh Goddes sonde;
This woeful woman he brought to the land.	This woful womman broghte he to the londe.
The constable, when he desired no longer to search,	The constable, whan hym lyst no longer seche,
A sort of corrupt Latin was her speech,	A maner Latyn corrupt was hir speche,
Her to deliver from the woe that she was in.	Hire to delivere of wo that she was inne.
The life out of her body to take away,	The lyf out of hir body for to twynne,
In her language mercy she besought,	In hir langage mercy she bisoghte,
He found also the treasure that she brought.	He foond also the tresor that she broghte.
And found this weary woman full of care;	And foond this wery womman ful of care;
To see this wreck, and all the ship he searched,	To seen this wrak, and al the ship he soghte,
The constable of the castle down has come	The constable of the castel doun is fare
The will of Christ was that she should remain there.	The wyl of Crist was that she sholde abyde.
And in the sand her ship stuck so fast	And in the sond hir ship stiked so faste
Far in Northumberland the waves cast her,	Fer in Northhumberlond the wawe hire caste,
Next to a castle that I can not name,	Under an hoold that nempnen I ne kan,
Throughout our wild sea, until at the last	Thurghout oure wilde see, til atte laste
She drives forth into our ocean	She dryveth forth into oure occian
God sent his plenty at their great need.	God sente his foyson at hir grete neede.
To feed with five loaves and two fish.	With loves fyve and fisshes two to feede.
It was as great marvel five thousand folk	Fyve thousand folk it was as greet mervaille
Or in desert? No person but Christ, without doubt.	Or in desert? No wight but Crist, sanz faille.
Three years and more? How lasts her store of provisions?	Thre yeer and moore? How lasteth hire vitaille?
Where could this woman have food and drink	Where myghte this womman mete and drynke have
As well when she woke as when she slept.	As wel whan she wook as whan she slepte.
Who from the tempest always this woman guarded	That fro the tempest ay this womman kepte
Truly, the commander of that was He	Soothly, the comandour of that was he
"Harm neither sea, nor land, nor tree"?	"Anoyeth neither see, ne land, ne tree"?
Both north and south, and also west and east,	Bothe north and south, and also west and est,
That have power to harm land and sea,	That power han t' anoyen lond and see,
Who commanded the four spirits of tempest	Who bad the foure spirites of tempest
Who kept the Hebrew people from their drowning,	That kepte peple Ebrayk from hir drenchynge,
Well may men know it was no one but He	Wel may men knowe it was no wight but he
Until he was spouted up at Nineveh?	Til he was spouted up at Nynyvee?
Who kept Jonas in the fish's maw	Who kepte Jonas in the fisshes mawe
Who kept her from the drowning in the sea?	Who kepte hire fro the drenchyng in the see?
Now since she was not slain at the feast,	Now sith she was nat at the feeste yslawe,
Can not know His prudent foresight.	Ne konne noght knowe his prudent purveiance.
To man's understanding, which, because of our ignorance,	To mannes wit, that for oure ignorance
Does something for a certain reason that is very obscure	Dooth thyng for certein ende that ful derk is
Christ, Who is a medicine for every harm,	Crist, which that is to every harm triacle,
In her, so that we should see his mighty works;	In hire, for we sholde seen his myghty werkis;
God wanted to show his wonderful miracle	God liste to shewe his wonderful myracle
No one but God Whom he bore in his heart.	No wight but God that he bar in his herte.
Was devoured by the lion before he could escape?	Was with the leon frete er he asterte?
Where every person except for him, master and servant,	Ther every wight save he, maister and knave,
Who saved Daniel in the horrible cave	Who saved Danyel in the horrible cave
And I answer to that question in reply,	And I answere to that demande agayn,
Also at the feast? Who could save her body?	Eek at the feeste? Who myghte hir body save?
Unto the place where she shall come to land.	Unto the place ther she shal arryve.
Before the wild waves will drive her	Er that the wilde wawes wol hire dryve
Full often may she expect her death,	After hir deeth ful often may she wayte,
On many a sorry meal now may she feed;	On many a sory meel now may she bayte;
Of Gibraltar, as it was her lot.	Of Marrok, as it was hire aventure.
Throughout the Sea of Greece unto the Strait	Thurghout the See of Grece unto the Strayte
Years and days floated this creature	Yeres and dayes fleet this creature
Guard me, and give me power my life to amend."	Me kepe, and yif me myght my lyf t' amenden."
Over which thy limbs faithfully extend,	On which thy lymes feithfully extenden,
The white Lamb, that hurt was with a spear,	The white Lamb, that hurt was with a spere,
The King of Heaven with his fresh wounds,	The Kyng of Hevene with his woundes newe,
That alone was worthy to bear	That oonly worthy were for to bere
"Victorious tree, protection of true (believers),	"Victorious tree, proteccioun of trewe,
That day that I shall drown in the deep.	That day that I shal drenchen in the depe.
Keep me from the fiend and from his claws,	Me fro the feend and fro his clawes kepe,
That washed the world from the old iniquity,	That wessh the world fro the olde iniquitee,
Red with the blood of the Lamb full of pity,	Reed of the Lambes blood ful of pitee,

And forth she sails in the salt see.	And forth she sailleth in the salte see.
They have given her, and clothes also she had,	They han hire yeven, and clothes eek she hadde,
And, to say the truth, a great store of provisions	And, sooth to seyn, vitaille greet plentee
A certain amount of treasure that she brought there,	A certein tresor that she thider ladde,
Out of Syria back to Italy.	Out of Surrye agaynward to Ytaille.
And in a ship entirely without a rudder, God knows,	And in a ship al steerelees, God woot,
And Custance have they taken right then, immediately,	And Custance han they take anon, foot-hoot,
Who was not all hacked to pieces before he could escape.	That he nas al tohewe er he asterted.
Who knew of the counsel of the Sultan (followed his advice),	That of the conseil of the Sowdan woot,
Nor there was any Syrian that was converted,	Ne ther was Surryen noon that was converted,
For she herself wanted to rule all the country.	For she hirself wolde al the contree lede.
Has with her friends done this cursed deed,	Hath with hir freendes doon this cursed dede,
This old Sultaness, cursed crone,	This olde Sowdanesse, cursed krone,
Except for only Lady Custance alone.	But it were oonly dame Custance allone.

For shortly to tell, at one word,	For shortly for to tellen, at o word,
The unexpected woe or harm that follows.	The unwar wo or harm that comth bihynde.
Upon thy glad day have in thy mind	Upon thy glade day have in thy mynde
Hearken to this counsel for thy safety:	Herke this conseil for thy sikernesse:
Woe takes over at the end of our gladness.	Wo occupieth the fyn of oure gladnesse.
The end of the joy of our worldly labor!	The ende of the joye of oure worldly labour!
To worldly bliss, sprinkled with bitterness,	To worldly blisse, spreynd with bitternesse,
O sudden woe, that ever art successor	O sodeyn wo, that evere art successour

Here may men behold feasting and royalty,	Heere may men feeste and roialtee biholde,
All together, yes, both young and old.	In general, ye, bothe yonge and olde.
And to the feast Christian folk go	And to the feeste Cristen folk hem dresse
Has arranged this feast of which I told,	Ordeyned hath this feeste of which I tolde,
The time having come, this old Sultaness	The tyme cam, this olde Sowdanesse
That revel should stint, and people go to their rest.	That revel stynte, and men goon to hir reste.
When time came, men thought it for the best	Whan tyme cam, men thoughte it for the beste
The essential part of this matter is what I tell.	The fruyt of this matiere is that I telle.
And welcomes her with all joy and bliss.	And welcometh hire with alle joye and blis.
So royally that it is a wonder to tell,	So roially that wonder is to telle,
The Sultan comes himself soon after this	The Sowdan comth hymself soone after this
Planned, under cover of this, very mortally to sting.	Caste under this ful mortally to stynge.

But this scorpion, this wicked spirit,	But this scorpioun, this wikked goost,
Than was the assembly of this blissful host.	Than was th' assemblee of this blisful hoost.

Of which Lucan makes such a boastful account,	Of which that Lucan maketh swich a boost,
At a slow pace solemnly they ride.	A softe paas solempnely they ryde.
And to the nearest city there beside	And to the nexte citee ther bisyde
As any mother might have for her daughter dear,	As any mooder myghte hir doghter deere,
Receives her with as glad a demeanor	Receyveth hire with also glad a cheere
The mother of the Sultan, richly dressed and gay,	The mooder of the Sowdan, riche and gay,
Of Syrians and Romans met together;	Of Surryens and Romayns met yfeere;
Large was the crowd, and rich was the assembly	Greet was the prees, and riche was th' array
The honor of his reign to sustain.	The honour of his regne to susteene.
And prayed her to ride to meet the queen,	And preyde hire for to ryde agayn the queene,
First to his mother, and all the reign about,	First to his mooder, and al the regne aboute,
And hastily this Sultan sent his messenger	And hastifliche this Sowdan sente his sonde
In Syria, with a great solemn company,	In Surrye, with a greet solempne route,
This Christian folk have come to land	Arryved been this Cristen folk to londe
She kissed her son, and home she goes her way.	She kiste hir sone, and hoom she gooth hir weye.
So glad he was, he knew not what to say.	So glad he was, he nyste what to seye.
And kneeling thanks her for that request.	And knelynge thanketh hire of that requeste.
The Sultan says, "I will act according to your command."	The Sowdan seith, "I wol doon at youre heeste,"
"To please them I will work hard."	"To plesen hem I wol do my labour."
Beseeching him to do her that honor,	Bisechynge hym to doon hire that honour,
Repenting that she heathen was so long,	Repentynge hire she hethen was so longe,
And take Christendom from a priest's hands,	And cristendom of preestes handes fonge,
And said to him that she would renounce her religion,	And seyde hym that she wolde reneye hir lay,
She rides to the Sultan on a day,	She rydeth to the Sowdan on a day,
Why should I in this tale longer tarry?	What sholde I in this tale lenger tarye?
Privately had her council go their way.	Leet prively hire conseil goon hire way.

Makest thou of women, when thou wilt deceive.	Makestow of wommen, whan thou wolt bigile.
Thou wilt destroy this Christian marriage.	Thou wolt fordoon this Cristen mariage.

To strengthen her shall try (to persuade) all his friends;	To strengthen hire shal alle his frendes fonde;
And every one, in the best way he can,	And everich, in the beste wise he kan,
To live with her and die, and by her stand,	To lyve with hire and dye, and by hire stonde,
They swore and agree, every man,	They sworen and assenten, every man,
And I shall make us safe for evermore?"	And I shal make us sauf for everemoore?"
As I shall say, assenting to my teaching,	As I shal seyn, assentynge to my loore,

And afterward to be dragged into hell,	And afterward in helle to be drawe,

This fresh May, when she these words heard,	This fresshe May, whan she thise wordes herde,
Now kiss me, wife, and let us roam about."	Now kys me, wyf, and lat us rome aboute."
Bear to be out of your company	Forbere to been out of youre compaignye
I can not, certainly, though I should die,	I may nat, certes, though I sholde dye,
And in addition to that the unsuitable old age of me,	And therwithal the unlikly elde of me,

Be to me true, and I will tell you why.	Beth to me trewe, and I wol telle yow why.
And although I be old and can not see,	And though that I be oold and may nat see,
But only for the love I had to thee.	But oonly for the love I had to thee.
Not for any greed, doubtless,	Noght for no coveitise, doutelees,
For God's sake, think how I thee chose,	For Goddes sake, thenk how I thee chees,
Than thee offend, true dear wife!	Than thee offende, trewe deere wyf!
For by that Lord that sits in heaven above,	For by that Lord that sit in hevene above,

And closed the gate quickly.	And clapte to the wyket sodeynly.
Into his fresh garden has gone,	Into his fresshe gardyn is ago,
With May in his hand, and no one else,	With Mayus in his hand, and no wight mo,
This January, as blind as is a stone,	This Januarie, as blynd as is a stoon,
And quickly he sits still under a bush.	And stille he sit under a bussh anon.
That no one could either see or hear it,	That no wight myghte it se neither yheere,
This Damian then has opened the gate,	This Damyan thanne hath opened the wyket,
That he should go before with his latchkey.	That he sholde go biforn with his cliket.
To Damian a sign made she,	On Damyan a signe made she,
Such old ignorant words used he.	Swiche olde lewed wordes used he.
I chose thee for my wife and my comfort."	I chees thee for my wyf and my confort."
Come forth, and let us take our pleasure;	Com forth, and lat us taken oure disport;
No blemish on thee knew I all my life.	No spot of thee ne knew I al my lyf.
Thou hast me wounded in my heart, O wife!	Thou hast me wounded in myn herte, O wyf!
Come forth, my white spouse! Beyond doubt	Com forth, my white spouse! Out of doute
How fairer are thy breasts than is wine!	How fairer been thy brestes than is wyn!
Come forth now, with thy dove-like eyes!	Com forth now, with thyne eyen columbyn!
The winter is gone with all his rains wet.	The wynter is goon with alle his reynes weete.
The turtle dove's voice is heard, my dove sweet;	The turtles voys is herd, my dowve sweete;
"Rise up, my wife, my love, my noble lady!	"Rys up, my wyf, my love, my lady free!
That in a morning unto his May says he:	That in a morwe unto his May seith he:
In his garden, and no one (there) but those two,	In his gardyn, and no wight but they tweye,
Through incitement of his wife, to enjoy himself	Thurgh eggyng of his wyf, hym for to pleye
That January has caught so great a desire,	That Januarie hath caught so greet a wil,
But now to purpose: before eight days	But now to purpos: er that dayes eighte
Where no one could have found such a trick.	Ther no wight koude han founde out swich a sleighte.
They are agreed, whispering through a wall,	They been accorded, rownynge thurgh a wal,
Though they were kept full long strictly in every way,	Thogh they were kept ful longe streite overal,
By Pyramus and Thisbe can one learn;	By Piramus and Tesbee may men leere;
That Love will not find it out in some manner?	That Love nyl fynde it out in som manere?
What trick is it, though (finding) it be long and painful,	What sleighte is it, thogh it be long and hoot,
O noble Ovid, full truth sayest thou, God knows,	O noble Ovyde, ful sooth seystou, God woot,
Which you shall hear, if you will abide.	Which ye shul heeren, if ye wole abyde.
There is no more to say, but hastily	Ther nys namoore to seye, but hastily
The latchkey counterfeited secretly.	The cliket countrefeted pryvely.
And Damian, who knew all her plan,	And Damyan, that knew al hire entente,
By which into his garden often he went;	By which into his gardyn ofte he wente;
That January carried of the small gate,	That Januarie bar of the smale wyket,
In warm wax has made an impression of the latchkey	In warm wex hath emprented the clyket
This fresh May, whom I spoke of formerly,	This fresshe May, that I spak of so yoore,
To overlook (trouble) is an advantage, I say no more.	Passe over is an ese, I sey namoore.
That confidently suppose indeed that it is not so.	That wenen wisly that it be nat so.
For all that ever he could peer or pry,	For al that evere he koude poure or pryen,
Lo, Argus, who had a hundred eyes,	Lo, Argus, which that hadde an hondred yen,
As to be deceived when a man can see.	As to be deceyved whan a man may se.
For it is as good to be deceived when blind	For as good is blynd deceyved be
Though thou could see as far as ships sail?	Thogh thou myghtest se as fer as shippes saille?
O January, what might it thee avail,	O Januarie, what myghte it thee availle,
And she knew also the aim of his plan.	And she knew eek the fyn of his entente.
And secret signs he knew what she meant,	And privee signes wiste he what she mente,
But nevertheless, by writing to and fro	But nathelees, by writyng to and fro
Without January's hearing it,	But if that Januarie moste it heere,
Regarding his purpose, of any such matter,	As to his purpos, of no swich mateere,
Could he speak one word to fresh May,	Ne myghte he speke a word to fresshe May,
That ever was, for neither night nor day	That evere was, for neither nyght ne day
Is become the most sorrowful man	Bicomen is the sorwefulleste man
Upon that other side Damian	Upon that oother syde Damyan
She expects that her heart would burst.	She wayteth whan hir herte wolde breste.
Or else she must have him as she wishes.	Or elles she moot han hym as hir leste.
That she must either die suddenly	That she moot outher dyen sodeynly
For which full often weeps fresh May,	For which ful ofte wepeth fresshe May,
Unless he had a hand always on her;	But if that he had hond on hire alway;
He would suffer her to ride or walk,	He nolde suffre hire for to ryde or go,
Nor in any other place, no longer,	Ne in noon oother place, neverthemo,
That neither in hall, nor in any other house,	That neither in halle, n' yn noon oother hous,
Which jealousy was so excessive	Which jalousye it was so outrageous
From being more jealous all the time;	That he nas jalous everemoore in oon;
Except that, no doubt, he can not refrain	Save, out of doute, he may nat forgoon
He patiently accepted his adversity,	He paciently took his adversitee,
His sorrow abated, truth to say;	His sorwe gan aswage, sooth to seye;
But at the last, after a month or two,	But atte laste, after a month or tweye,
Solitary as the turtledove that lost has her mate.	Soul as the turtle that lost hath hire make.
But ever live as widow in clothes black,	But evere lyve as wydwe in clothes blake,
Would he that she were neither lover nor wife,	Ne wolde he that she were love ne wyf,
For neither after his death nor in his life	For neither after his deeth nor in his lyf
That some man both her and him had slain.	That som man bothe hire and hym had slayn.
So burned his heart that he sincerely wished	So brente his herte that he wolde fayn
Lest that his wife should fall in some folly,	Lest that his wyf sholde falle in som folye,
He weeps and he wails pitifully;	He wepeth and he wayleth pitously;
Is grown blind, and that all suddenly.	Is woxen blynd, and that al sodeynly.
Amid his pleasure and his prosperity,	Amydde his lust and his prosperitee,
Alas, this noble generous January,	Allas, this noble Januarie free,
For sorrow of which he desires to die.	For sorwe of which desireth he to dyen.
And now thou hast deprived him of both his eyes,	And now thou hast biraft hym bothe his yen,
Thou who had received him for thy closest friend ?	That haddest hym for thy fulle freend receyved?
Why hast thou January thus deceived,	Why hastow Januarie thus deceyved,
That thou deceivest both high and low (everyone)!	That thou deceyvest bothe moore and lesse!
O monster, that so subtly can disguise	O monstre, that so subtilly kanst peynte
O brittle joy! O sweet venom deceitful!	O brotil joye! O sweete venym queynte!
Thy tail is death, through thy poisoning.	Thy tayl is deeth, thurgh thyn envenymynge.
That flatter with thy head when thou wilt sting;	That flaterest with thyn heed whan thou wolt stynge;
Similar to the scorpion so deceitful,	Lyk to the scorpion so deceyvable,
O sudden chance! O thou Fortune unstable!	O sodeyn hap! O thou Fortune unstable!
To January, nor to any creature.	To Januarie, ne to no creature.
But worldly joy can not always endure	But worldly joye may nat alwey dure
Lived this January and fresh May.	Lyved this Januarie and fresshe May.
He in the garden performed and accomplished them.	He in the gardyn parfourned hem and spedde.
And things which that were not done abed,	And thynges whiche that were nat doon abedde,
And May his wife, and no one but those two;	And May his wyf, and no wight but they two;
In summer season, thither would he go,	In somer seson, thider wolde he go,
And when he would pay his wife her marital debt	And whan he wolde paye his wyf hir dette
With which, when he desired, he unlocked it.	With which, whan that hym leste, he it unshette.
He bore always of silver a latchkey,	He baar alwey of silver a clyket,
Save he himself; for of the small gate	Save he hymself; for of the smale wyket
That he will no one allow to bear the key	That he wol no wight suffren bere the keye
This noble knight, this January the old,	This noble knyght, this Januarie the olde,
About that well, and danced, as men told.	Aboute that welle, and daunced, as men tolde.
Amused themselves and made melody	Disporten hem and maken melodye
Proserpine, and all their fairies,	Proserpina, and al hire fayerye,
Very often he, Pluto, and his queen,	Ful ofte tyme he Pluto and his queene,
That stood under a laurel always green.	That stood under a laurer alwey grene.
The beauty of the garden and the well	The beautee of the gardyn and the welle
Though he be god of gardens, to tell	Though he be god of gardyns, for to telle
Nor Priapus could not be adequate,	Ne Priapus ne myghte nat suffise,
That he who wrote the Romance of the Rose	That he that wroot the Romance of the Rose
For, beyond doubt, I truly suppose	For, out of doute, I verraily suppose
So fair a garden know I anywhere none.	So fair a gardyn woot I nowher noon.
He made a garden, walled all with stone;	He made a gardyn, walled al with stoon;
Amongst others of his suitable things,	Amonges othere of his honeste thynges,
To his degree was made as is a king's.	To his degree was maked as a kynges.
His lodging, his clothing, as suitably	His housynge, his array, as honestly
Arranged for himself to live full voluptuously.	Shoop hym to lyve ful deliciously.
In a respectable manner, as is suitable to a knight,	In honest wyse, as longeth to a knyght,
Consists of delight, and therefore certainly he,	Stant in delit, and therfore certeyn he,
Some clerks maintain that felicity	Somme clerkes holden that felicitee
And in my tale forth I will proceed.	And in my tale forth I wol procede.
Thus leave I Damian going about his business,	Thus lete I Damyan aboute his nede,
And fully in his lady's favor he stood.	And fully in his lady grace he stood.
That every one is eager to speak good of him,	That every wight is fayn to speke hym good,
(For craft is all, whoever can do it)	(For craft is al, whoso that do it kan)
He is so pleasant unto every man	He is so plesant unto every man
As ever did a dog trained to hunt with an archer.	As evere dide a dogge for the bowe.
He does all that his lady desires and pleases,	He dooth al that his lady lust and lyketh,
He combs himself, he preens and neatens himself,	He kembeth hym, he preyneth hym and pyketh,
All passed was his sickness and his sorrow.	Al passed was his siknesse and his sorwe.
Up rises Damian the next morning;	Up riseth Damyan the nexte morwe;
To January, when he for her sent.	To Januarie, whan that he for hire sente.
And bade him be all healthy, and forth she went	And bad hym been al hool, and forth she wente
So secretly that no one knew of it,	So secrely that no wight of it wiste,
She takes him by the hand and hard him squeezes	She taketh hym by the hand and harde hym twiste
Under his pillow; let him read it if he wishes.	Under his pilwe; rede it if hym leste.
To visit this Damian goes May,	To visite this Damyan gooth May,
And when she saw her time, upon one day	And whan she saugh hir tyme, upon a day
For it shall be right as he will devise.	For it shal be right as he wole devyse.
Where she might satisfy his desires,	Wher that she myghte unto his lust suffise,
There lacks nothing but only day and place	Ther lakketh noght oonly but day and place
In which she grants him her true grace.	In which she graunteth hym hire verray grace.
In her own hand a letter made she,	Right of hire hand a lettre made she,
This gentle May, filled full of pity,	This gentil May, fulfilled of pitee,
And care not to be a homicide.	And rekke nat to been an homycide.
Well rather than have granted him her grace,	Wel rather than han graunted hym hire grace,
Who would have let him die in the place	Which wolde han lat hym sterven in the place
Who has a heart as hard as any stone,	That hath an herte as hard as any stoon,
Some tyrant is, as there be many a one	Som tyrant is, as ther be many oon
In women is, when they carefully deliberate a matter.	In wommen is, whan they hem narwe avyse.
Here can you see what excellent generosity	Heere may ye se how excellent franchise
Lo, pity runs soon in gentle heart!	Lo, pitee renneth soone in gentil herte!
Though he had no more than his shirt."	Though he namoore hadde than his sherte."
To love him best of any creature,	To love hym best of any creature,
"Certainly," thought she, "whomever this thing may displease	"Certeyn," thoghte she, "whom that this thyng displese
The thought to comfort him.	The remembrance for to doon hym ese.
That from her heart she can not drive	That from hire herte she ne dryve kan
Of pity for this sick Damian	Of pitee of this sike Damyan
Has taken such impression that day	Hath take swich impression that day
But truth is this, how this fresh May	But sooth is this, how that this fresshe May
May he judge of all, for I will hold my peace.	He deme of al, for I wole holde my pees.
That knows that no act is without cause,	That knoweth that noon act is causelees,
I can not say; but great God above,	I kan nat seye; but grete God above,
For every thing has time, as say these clerks --	For alle thyng hath tyme, as seyn thise clerkes --
Was to present a petition concerning Venus' works --	Was for to putte a bille of Venus werkes --
The heaven stood that time that it fortunate	The hevene stood that tyme fortunaat
Or configuration of the stars, that in such a state	Or constellacion, that in swich estaat
Were it by astronomical influence or by nature,	Were it by influence or by nature,
Were it by destiny or by chance,	Were it by destynee or by aventure,
Until bell for evening prayers rang and they had to arise.	Til evensong rong and that they moste aryse.
But here I let them work in their way	But heere I lete hem werken in hir wyse
Or whether she thought it paradise or hell.	Or wheither hire thoughte it paradys or helle.
But lest that prudish folk be with me wroth,	But lest that precious folk be with me wrooth,
And she obeys, whether she wants to or not.	And she obeyeth, be hire lief or looth.
He said her clothes got in his way,	He seyde hir clothes dide hym encombraunce,
He would of her, he said, have some pleasure;	He wolde of hire, he seyde, han som plesaunce;
Straightway he prayed her to strip herself all naked;	Anon he preyde hire strepen hire al naked;
Who slept until the cough has him awaked.	That sleep til that the coughe hath hym awaked.
Down by old January she lay,	Adoun by olde Januarie she lay,
Who is perplexed now but fair fresh May?	Who studieth now but faire fresshe May?
And in the privy softly threw it.	And in the pryvee softely it caste.
And when she of this letter has taken heed,	And whan she of this bille hath taken heede,
Where you know that every person must go by necessity;	Ther as ye woot that every wight moot neede;
She pretended that she must go	She feyned hire as that she moste gon
And laid him down to sleep, and that straightway.	And leyde hym doun to slepe, and that anon.
He takes her, and kisses her full often,	He taketh hire, and kisseth hire ful ofte,
Who on his bed's side sits full softly.	That on his beddes syde sit ful softe.
But unto January come is she,	But unto Januarie ycomen is she,
And went her way; you get no more from me.	And wente hire wey; ye gete namoore of me.
This purse has she within her bosom hidden	This purs hath she inwith hir bosom hyd
"Mercy! And (I ask) that you not discover me,	"Mercy! And that ye nat discovere me,
And softly to her right thus said he:	And softely to hire right thus seyde he:
Save that he sighs wonderfully deep and sore,	Save that he siketh wonder depe and soore,
Has put into her hand, without (doing) more,	Hath put into hire hand, withouten moore,
In which he had written his desire,	In which that he ywriten hadde his wille,
In a secret way his purse and also his letter,	In secree wise his purs and eek his bille,
This Damian, when he saw his opportunity,	This Damyan, whan that his tyme he say,
Comforting him as graciously as she can.	Confortynge hym as goodly as she may.
Down by his bed's side sits she then,	Doun by his beddes syde sit she than,
This fresh May has held straight her way	This fresshe May hath streight hir wey yholde
And told him certain things, what he wanted.	And tolde hym certeyn thynges, what he wolde.
A squire, that was master of ceremonies of his hall,	A squier, that was marchal of his halle,
And with that word he began to him to call	And with that word he gan to hym to calle
Until you sleep fast by my side."	Til that ye slepe faste by my syde."
And hurry yourself, for I will wait	And spede yow faste, for I wole abyde
When I have done nothing but rested myself a little;	Have I no thyng but rested me a lite;
And tell him that I will him visit,	And telleth hym that I wol hym visite,
Cheer him up -- he is a gentle man;	Dooth hym disport -- he is a gentil man;
When you have been in chamber out of this hall,	Whan ye han been in chambre out of this halle,
At after-dinner you with all your women,	At after-mete ye with youre wommen alle,
"My Lady," said this January, "take good heed,	"Dame," quod this Januarie, "taak good hede,
His squire, for it was a gentle deed.	His squier, for it was a gentil dede.
He would so comfort in sickness	He wolde so conforten in siknesse
That of his goodness and his graciousness	That of his bountee and his gentillesse
And for that word every man blessed him,	And for that word hym blessed every man,
To do him all the comfort that I can."	To doon hym al the confort that I kan."
I will myself visit him, and also May,	I wol myself visite hym, and eek May,
And to be a worthy man right able.	And for to been a thrifty man right able.
And moreover manly, and also willing to serve,	And therto manly, and eek servysable,
As any man I know of his rank,	As any man I woot of his degree,
He is as wise, discreet, and as circumspect	He is as wys, discreet, and as secree
If he died, it would be a harm and a pity.	If that he deyde, it were harm and routhe.
"He is a gentle squire, by my troth!	"He is a gentil squier, by my trouthe!
"I am sorry about that," said this January,	"That me forthynketh," quod this Januarie,
No other cause might make him tarry.	Noon oother cause myghte make hym tarye.
Which prevented him from doing his duties;	Which letted hym to doon his bisynesse;
His squires, who stood there beside,	His squieres, whiche that stooden ther bisyde,
Is he always sick, or how can this happen?"	Is he ay syk, or how may this bityde?"
That Damian does not attend on me?	That Damyan entendeth nat to me?
And said, "Saint Mary! how can this be,	And seyde, "Seynte Marie! how may this be,
Remembered this Damian,	Remembred hym upon this Damyan,
And so befell that this good man	And so bifel how that this goode man
As fresh as is the bright summer's day.	As fressh as is the brighte someres day.
In hall this January and May sit,	In halle sit this Januarie and May,
When the high mass was done,	Whan that the heighe masse was ydoon,
Are passed; then let her go to feast.	Ypassed been; thanne lat hire go to feeste.
Until four days, or three days at the least,	Til dayes foure, or thre dayes atte leeste,
A bride shall not eat in the hall	A bryde shal nat eten in the halle
As custom is unto these nobles all.	As custume is unto thise nobles alle.
So long has May in her chamber abided,	So longe hath Mayus in hir chambre abyden,
In two degrees of Taurus, was into Cancer glided;	In two of Tawr, was into Cancre glyden;
That January has wedded fresh May	That Januarie hath wedded fresshe May
The moon, that was at noon that same day	The moone, that at noon was thilke day
He has put it, and laid it at his heart.	He hath it put, and leyde it at his herte.
Unto his fair, fresh lady May;	Unto his faire, fresshe lady May;
In the manner of a poetic lament or a song,	In manere of a compleynt or a lay,
And in a letter wrote he all his sorrow,	And in a lettre wroot he al his sorwe,
But secretly a writing set he borrowed,	But prively a penner gan he borwe,
No longer could he in this way endure,	No lenger myghte he in this wise endure,
For which he put his life at risk.	For which he putte his lyf in aventure.
So burns that he dies for desire,	So brenneth that he dyeth for desyr,
This sick Damian in Venus' fire	This sike Damyan in Venus fyr
God be thy help! I can no better say."	God be thyn helpe! I kan no bettre seye."
Tell thy woe? She will always say nay.	Telle thy wo? She wole alwey seye nay.
How shalt thou to thy lady, fresh May,	How shaltow to thy lady, fresshe May,
Answer to my question, in this case.	Andswere to my demaunde, as in this cas.
I say, "O innocent Damian, alas!	I seye, "O sely Damyan, allas!
Therefore I speak to him in this manner:	Therfore I speke to hym in this manere:
That languishes for love, as you shall hear;	That langwissheth for love, as ye shul heere;
Now will I speak of woeful Damian,	Now wol I speke of woful Damyan,
Be it of fish, or bird, or beast, or man.	Be it of fyssh, or bryd, or beest, or man.
This is to say, no living creature,	This is to seyn, no lyves creature,
For every labor sometime must have rest,	For every labour somtyme moot han reste,
As is the best usage of wives.	As usage is of wyves for the beste.
Held her chamber until the fourth day,	Heeld hire chambre unto the fourthe day,
Up rises January; but fresh May	Up ryseth Januarie; but fresshe May
And afterwards, when he saw his time,	And afterward, whan that he saugh his tyme,
And down he laid his head and slept until nine.	And doun he leyde his heed and sleep til pryme.
Now day is come, I can no longer remain awake."	Now day is come, I may no lenger wake."
Then said he thus, "My rest will I take;	Thanne seide he thus, "My reste wol I take;
She rates his playing not worth a bean.	She preyseth nat his pleyyng worth a bene.
When she saw him sitting up in his shirt,	Whan she hym saugh up sittynge in his sherte,
But God knows what May thought in her heart,	But God woot what that May thoughte in hir herte,
While he sang, so chants he and croaks.	Whil that he sang, so chaunteth he and craketh.
The slack skin about his neck shakes	The slakke skyn aboute his nekke shaketh
And full of chatter as a spotted magpie.	And ful of jargon as a flekked pye.
He was frisky as a colt, full of wantonness,	He was al coltissh, ful of ragerye,
And kissed his wife, and acted lecherously.	And kiste his wyf, and made wantown cheere.
And after that he sang full loud and clear,	And after that he sang ful loude and cleere,
And upright in his bed then sits he,	And upright in his bed thanne sitteth he,
Thus labors he until the day dawned;	Thus laboureth he til that the day gan dawe;
For we have leave by the law to enjoy ourselves."	For we han leve to pleye us by the lawe."
Nor hurt himself with his own knife,	Ne hurte hymselven with his owene knyf,
A man can do no sin with his wife,	A man may do no synne with his wyf,
For in our acts we can do no sin.	For in oure actes we mowe do no synne.
And blessed be the yoke that we are in,	And blessed be the yok that we been inne,
In true wedlock we two are coupled,	In trewe wedlok coupled be we tweye,
It does not matter how long we play;	It is no fors how longe that we pleye;
This will be done at leisure perfectly.	This wol be doon at leyser parfitly.
"There is no workman, whosoever he be,	"Ther nys no werkman, whatsoevere he be,
But nevertheless, consider this," said he,	But nathelees, considereth this," quod he,

He rubs her about her tender face,	He rubbeth hire aboute hir tendre face,
For he was all freshly shaved in his fashion --	For he was shave al newe in his manere --
Like to the skin of a shark, sharp as brier --	Lyk to the skyn of houndfyssh, sharp as brere --
With thick bristles of his beard rough,	With thikke brustles of his berd unsofte,
His fresh May, his paradise, his mate.	His fresshe May, his paradys, his make.
And January has fast in arms taken	And Januarie hath faste in armes take
Out of the chamber has every one gone,	Out of the chambre hath every wight hym dressed,
And when the bed was by the priest blessed,	And whan the bed was with the preest yblessed,
The bride was brought to bed as still as stone;	The bryde was broght abedde as stille as stoon;
Men drink and draw the curtain (dividing the room) straightway.	Men drynken and the travers drawe anon.
And they have done right as he will command.	And they han doon right as he wol devyse.
Have all this house emptied in courteous manner."	Lat voyden al this hous in curteys wyse."

And many a very fine aphrodisiac has he,	And many a letuarie hath he ful fyn,
With hot spices to increase his desire;	Of spices hoote t' encreessen his corage;
He drinks mulled wine, claret, and strong white wine	He drynketh ypocras, clarree, and vernage
Would go to bed; he would no longer tarry.	Wolde go to bedde; he wolde no lenger tarye.
Soon after that, this hasty January	Soone after that, this hastif Januarie
And when they see their time, go to rest.	And whan they sye hir tyme, goon to reste.
Home to their houses cheerfully they ride,	Hoom to hir houses lustily they ryde,
From January, with thanks on all sides.	Fro Januarie, with thank on every syde.
For which departed is this cheerful crowd	For which departed is this lusty route
Did overspread the hemisphere about;	Gan oversprede the hemysperie aboute;
Night with its mantle, that is dark and rude,	Night with his mantel, that is derk and rude,
On the horizon, in that latitude.	On th' orisonte, as in that latitude.
No longer can its body sojourn	No lenger may the body of hym sojurne
The sun has completed his daily journey;	Parfourned hath the sonne his ark diurne;
Than a foe in thy household always in thy presence.	Than hoomly foo al day in thy presence.
God grant thee thy foe in thy household to espy!	God graunte thee thyn hoomly fo t' espye!
Intends to do thee villainy.	Entendeth for to do thee vileynye.
Thine own squire and thy servant from birth,	Thyn owene squier and thy borne man,
In marriage, see how thy Damian,	In mariage, se how thy Damyan,
O January, drunk with pleasure	O Januarie, dronken in plesaunce
God protect us all from your acquaintance!	God shilde us alle from youre aqueyntaunce!

O servant traitor, false domestic servant,	O servant traytour, false hoomly hewe,
O enemy in one's household, that offers his service!	O famulier foo, that his servyce bedeth!
Until fresh May will rue on his pain.	Til fresshe May wol rewen on his peyne.
But there I let him weep enough and complain	But there I lete hym wepe ynogh and pleyne
No more of him at this time speak I,	Namoore of hym at this tyme speke I,
And to his bed he went hastily.	And to his bed he wente hym hastily.
As she carried it dancing in her hand;	As that she bar it daunsynge in hire hond;
So sorely has Venus hurt him with her torch,	So soore hath Venus hurt hym with hire brond,
Almost he fainted and swooned where he stood,	Almoost he swelte and swowned ther he stood,
That for the very pain he was nearly crazy.	That for the verray peyne he was ny wood.
He was so ravished on his lady May	He was so ravysshed on his lady May
All but a squire, called Damian,	Al but a squyer, highte Damyan,
And full of joy and bliss is every man --	And ful of joye and blisse is every man --
And spiced cakes all about the house they passed,	And spices al aboute the hous they caste,
And after that men dance and drink deeply,	And after that men daunce and drynken faste,
The time came that it was reasonable to rise;	The tyme cam that resoun was to ryse;
To hasten them from the dinner in subtle manner.	To haste hem fro the mete in subtil wyse.

Harder than ever Paris did Helen of Troy.	Harder than evere Parys dide Eleyne.
But in his heart he began to menace her	But in his herte he gan hire to manace

Filled with all beauty and delight.	Fulfild of alle beautee and plesaunce.

Who are wedded. I believe that it is so,	That wedded been. I trowe that it be so,

The Prologue of the Merchant's Tale.	The Prologe of the Marchantes Tale.
Here ends the Miller's Tale.	Heere endeth the Millere his Tale.
This tale is done, and God save all this company!	This tale is doon, and God save al the rowte!
And Nicholas is scalded in the rump.	And Nicholas is scalded in the towte.
And Absolon has kissed her lower eye,	And Absolon hath kist hir nether ye,
In spite of all his guarding and his jealousy,	For al his kepyng and his jalousye,
Thus screwed was this carpenter's wife,	Thus swyved was this carpenteris wyf,
And every person did laugh at this strife.	And every wight gan laughen at this stryf.
For every clerk immediately agreed with the other.	For every clerk anonright heeld with oother.
That he was considered crazy in all the town;	That he was holde wood in al the toun;
With oaths great he was so sworn down	With othes grete he was so sworn adoun
It was for naught; no one listened to his explanation,	It was for noght; no man his reson herde.
For whatever this carpenter answered,	For what so that this carpenter answerde,
And turned all his harm into a joke.	And turned al his harm unto a jape.
Into the roof they stare and they gape,	Into the roof they kiken and they cape,
The folk did laugh at his foolishness;	The folk gan laughen at his fantasye;
To sit in the roof, to keep him company.	To sitten in the roof, par compaignye.
And had hanged them in the roof above;	And hadde hem hanged in the roof above;
He had bought himself three kneading tubs,	He hadde yboght hym knedyng tubbes thre,
Because of his imagination that in his foolishness	Thurgh fantasie that of his vanytee
He was so afraid of Nowell's flood	He was agast so of Nowelis flood
They told every one that he was crazy;	They tolden every man that he was wood;
By clever Nicholas and Alisoun.	With hende Nicholas and Alisoun.
For when he spoke, he was immediately put down	For whan he spak, he was anon bore doun
But he had to stand up for himself, though it went badly;	But stonde he moste unto his owene harm;
For with the fall he had broken his arm.	For with the fal he brosten hadde his arm.
Run in to gawk at this man,	In ronnen for to gauren on this man,
The neighbors, both low-ranking and high,	The neighebores, bothe smale and grete,
And cried "Out" and "Help" in the street.	And criden "Out" and "Harrow" in the strete.
Up started Alison and Nicholay,	Up stirte hire Alison and Nicholay,
Upon the floor, and there he lay in a swoon.	Upon the floor, and ther aswowne he lay.
Neither bread nor ale, until he came to the pavement	Ne breed ne ale, til he cam to the celle
And down goes all; he found nothing to sell (wasted no time),	And doun gooth al; he foond neither to selle,
And with his ax he smote the cord in two,	And with his ax he smoot the corde atwo,
He sits up without more words,	He sit hym up withouten wordes mo,
And heard someone cry "water!" as if he were crazy,	And herde oon crien "water!" as he were wood,
This carpenter woke suddenly out of his slumber,	This carpenter out of his slomber sterte,
"Help! Water! Water! Help, for God's heart!"	"Help! Water! Water! Help, for Goddes herte!"
As if he were crazy, for woe he began to cry,	As he were wood, for wo he gan to crye,
And for the pain he thought he would die.	And for the smert he wende for to dye.
The hot plough blade so burned his rump	The hoote kultour brende so his toute,
Off goes the skin a hand's breadth about,	Of gooth the skyn an hande-brede aboute,
And he smote Nicholas in the middle of the ass.	And Nicholas amydde the ers he smoot.
And he was ready with his hot iron,	And he was redy with his iren hoot,
As great as if it had been a thunder-bolt,	As greet as it had been a thonder-dent,
This Nicholas immediately let fly a fart	This Nicholas anon leet fle a fart
"Speak, sweet bird, I know not where thou art."	"Spek, sweete bryd, I noot nat where thou art."
And then spoke this clerk, this Absolon,	And therwith spak this clerk, this Absolon,
Over the buttock, to the thigh;	Over the buttok, to the haunche-bon;
And he puts out his ass stealthily	And out his ers he putteth pryvely
And he opened up the window hastily,	And up the wyndowe dide he hastily,
He should kiss his ass before he escapes.	He sholde kisse his ers er that he scape.
And thought he would make the joke even better;	And thoughte he wolde amenden al the jape;
This will I give thee, if thou kiss me."	This wol I yeve thee, if thou me kisse."
Very fine it is, and also nicely engraved.	Ful fyn it is, and therto wel ygrave.
My mother gave it to me, as God may save me;	My mooder yaf it me, so God me save;
Of gold," said he, "I have brought thee a ring.	Of gold," quod he, "I have thee broght a ryng.
I am thy Absolon, my darling.	I am thyn Absolon, my deerelyng.
"Why, nay," said he, "God knows, my sweet beloved,	"Why, nay," quod he, "God woot, my sweete leef,
That knocks so? I swear it is a thief."	That knokketh so? I warante it a theef."
This Alison answered, "Who is there	This Alison answerde, "Who is ther
Upon the window, just as he did before.	Upon the wyndowe, right as he dide er.
And went unto the carpenter's wall.	And wente unto the carpenteris wal.
Very softly out at the door he began to steal,	Ful softe out at the dore he gan to stele,
And caught the plough blade by the cold handle.	And caughte the kultour by the colde stele.
I shall well tell it to thee to-morrow" --	I shal wel telle it thee to-morwe day" --
"Concerning that," said Absolon, "be as be may.	"Therof," quod Absolon, "be as be may.
Ay, Christ's foe! What will you do with it?"	Ey, Cristes foo! What wol ye do therwith?"
Thou sholdest have it, as I am true smith.	Thou sholdest have, as I am trewe smyth.
Or in a sack countless silver coins,	Or in a poke nobles alle untold,
Gerveys answered, "Certainly, were it gold,	Gerveys answerde, "Certes, were it gold,
Lend it to me; I have something to do with it,	As lene it me; I have therwith to doone,
That hot plough blade in the hearth here,	That hoote kultour in the chymenee heere,
Than Gerveys knew, and said, "Friend so dear,	Than Gerveys knew, and seyde, "Freend so deere,
He had more business on hand	He hadde moore tow on his distaf
For all his joking; no word he gave in reply;	Of al his pley; no word agayn he yaf;
This Absolon cared not a bean	This Absolon ne roghte nat a bene
By Saint Note, you know well what I mean."	By Seinte Note, ye woot wel what I mene."
Hath brought you to be running around like this.	Hath broght yow thus upon the viritoot.
What ails yow? Some pretty girl, God knows it,	What eyleth yow? Som gay gerl, God it woot,
"What, Absolon! for Christ's sweet cross,	"What, Absolon! for Cristes sweete tree,
"What, who art thou?" "It am I, Absolon."	"What, who artow?" "It am I, Absolon."
And said, "Open up, Gerveys, and that right now."	And seyde, "Undo, Gerveys, and that anon."
This Absolon knocked all gently,	This Absolon knokketh al esily,
He sharpens ploughshares and plough blades busily.	He sharpeth shaar and kultour bisily.
Who in his forge made plowing equipment;	That in his forge smythed plough harneys;
To a smith men called dan Gerveys,	Until a smyth men cleped daun Gerveys,
At a slow pace he went down the street	A softe paas he wente over the strete
And wept as does a child that is beaten.	And weep as dooth a child that is ybete.
For he was healed of his malady.	For he was heeled of his maladie.
Love-making he thought not worth not a watercress,	Of paramours he sette nat a kers,
For from that time that he had kissed her ass,	For fro that tyme that he hadde kist hir ers,
His hot love was cold and all extinguished;	His hoote love was coold and al yqueynt;
Alas," said he, "alas, I did not turn away!"	Allas," quod he, "allas, I ne hadde ybleynt!"
"Be avenged for this insult.	"Of this despit awroken for to be.
If I would not rather than (have) all this town," said he,	But me were levere than al this toun," quod he,
"My soul I entrust to Satan,	"My soule bitake I unto Sathanas,
But Absolon, who says very often, "Alas!"	But Absolon, that seith ful ofte, "Allas!"
Who rubs now, who now scrubs his lips	Who rubbeth now, who froteth now his lippes
And to himself he said, "I shall pay thee back."	And to hymself he seyde, "I shal thee quyte."
And on his lip he began for anger to bite,	And on his lippe he gan for anger byte,
This hapless Absolon heard every bit,	This sely Absolon herde every deel,
"By God's body, this goes fair and well."	"By Goddes corpus, this goth faire and weel."
"A beard! A beard!" said clever Nicholas,	"A berd! A berd!" quod hende Nicholas,
And Absolon goes forth walking sadly.	And Absolon gooth forth a sory pas.
"Tehee!" said she, and clapped the window to,	"Tehee!" quod she, and clapte the wyndow to,
And said, "Fie! alas! what have I done?"	And seyde, "Fy! allas! what have I do?"
For well he knew a woman has no beard.	For wel he wiste a womman hath no berd.
Back he jumped, and thought it was amiss,	Abak he stirte, and thoughte it was amys,
With great relish, before he was aware of this.	Ful savourly, er he were war of this.
But with his mouth he kissed her naked ass	But with his mouth he kiste hir naked ers
And Absolon, to him it happened no better nor worse,	And Absolon, hym fil no bet ne wers,
And at the window out she put her hole,	And at the wyndow out she putte hir hole,
Dark was the night as pitch, or as the coal,	Derk was the nyght as pich, or as the cole,
This Absolon wiped his mouth very dry.	This Absolon gan wype his mouth ful drie.
Lest our neighbors espy thee."	Lest that oure neighebores thee espie."
The window she undoes, and that in haste.	The wyndow she undoth, and that in haste.
Sweetheart, thy grace, and sweet bird, thy mercy!"	Lemman, thy grace, and sweete bryd, thyn oore!"
For after this I hope there comes more.	For after this I hope ther cometh moore.
And said, "I am a lord in every way;	And seyde, "I am a lord at alle degrees;
This Absolon set himself down on his knees	This Absolon doun sette hym on his knees
"Now hush, and thou shalt laugh all thy fill."	"Now hust, and thou shalt laughen al thy fille."
And unto Nicholas she said quietly,	And unto Nicholas she seyde stille,
"Then make thee ready," said she, "I come right now."	"Thanne make thee redy," quod she, "I come anon."
"Yes, certainly, sweetheart," said this Absolon.	"Ye, certes, lemman," quod this Absolon.
For Jesus' love, and for the love of me."	For Jhesus love, and for the love of me."
Then kiss me, since it can be no better,	Thanne kysse me, syn it may be no bet,
That true love was ever in such miserable circumstances!	That trewe love was evere so yvel biset!
"Alas," said Absolon, "and woe is me,	"Allas," quod Absolon, "and weylawey,
And let me sleep, in the name of twenty devils!"	And lat me slepe, a twenty devel wey!"
Go forth thy way, or I will cast a stone,	Go forth thy wey, or I wol caste a ston,
Well better than thee, by Jesus, Absolon.	Wel bet than thee, by Jhesu, Absolon.
I love another -- and else I were to blame --	I love another -- and elles I were to blame --
"So help me God, it will not be `come kiss me.'	"As help me God, it wol nat be `com pa me.'
I can eat no more than a maiden."	I may nat ete na moore than a mayde."
That like a true turtledove is my mourning.	That lik a turtel trewe is my moornynge.
Indeed, sweetheart, I have such love-longing	Ywis, lemman, I have swich love-longynge
I mourn as does a lamb after the tit.	I moorne as dooth a lamb after the tete.
No wonder is though that I swelter and sweat;	No wonder is thogh that I swelte and swete;
That for your love I sweat wherever I go.	That for youre love I swete ther I go.
Well little you think upon my woe,	Wel litel thynken ye upon my wo,
Awake, sweetheart mine, and speak to me!	Awaketh, lemman myn, and speketh to me!
My fair bird, my sweet cinnamon?	My faire bryd, my sweete cynamome?
And softly he coughs with a gentle sound:	And softe he cougheth with a semy soun:
Unto his breast it reached, it was so low --	Unto his brest it raughte, it was so lowe --
And he stands still under the casement window --	And stille he stant under the shot-wyndowe --
He goes to the carpenter's house,	He rometh to the carpenteres hous,
For thus he thought he would be gracious.	For therby wende he to ben gracious.
Under his tongue he had a true-love herb,	Under his tonge a trewe-love he beer,
To smell sweet, ere he had combed his hair.	To smellen sweete, er he hadde kembd his heer.
But first he chews cardamom and licorice,	But first he cheweth greyn and lycorys,
And dresses himself handsomely, in every detail.	And hym arraieth gay, at poynt-devys.
When the first cock has crowed (about midnight), at once	Whan that the firste cok hath crowe, anon
And all the night then will I stay awake and play."	And al the nyght thanne wol I wake and pleye."
Therefore I will go sleep an hour or two,	Therfore I wol go slepe an houre or tweye,
All night I dreamed also I was at a feast.	Al nyght me mette eek I was at a feeste.
That is a sign of kissing at the least.	That is a signe of kissyng atte leeste.
My mouth has itched all this long day;	My mouth hath icched al this longe day;
Some sort of comfort shall I have, by my faith.	Som maner confort shal I have, parfay.
That at the very least I shall her kiss.	That at the leeste wey I shal hire kisse.
My love-longing, for yet I shall not miss	My love-longynge, for yet I shal nat mysse
That stands very low upon his bedroom's wall.	That stant ful lowe upon his boures wal.
Very quietly knock at his window	Ful pryvely knokken at his wyndowe
"As I may prosper, I shall, at cock's crow,	"So moot I thryve, I shal, at cokkes crowe,
About his door, since day began to spring.	Aboute his dore, syn day bigan to sprynge.
For surely I saw him not stirring	For sikirly I saugh hym nat stirynge
And thought, "Now is time to stay awake all night,	And thoghte, "Now is tyme to wake al nyght,
This Absolon very was jolly and happy,	This Absolon ful joly was and light,
Where he may be, I can not truly say."	Where that he be, I kan nat soothly seyn."
Or else he is at his house, certainly.	Or elles he is at his hous, certeyn.
For he is accustomed to go for timber	For he is wont for tymber for to go
For timber, where our abbot has sent him;	For tymber, ther oure abbot hath hym sent;
Since Saturday; I suppose that he is gone	Syn Saterday; I trowe that he be went
And said, "I know not; I have not seen him working here	And seyde, "I noot; I saugh hym heere nat wirche
And he drew him apart out of the church,	And he drough hym apart out of the chirche,
Very discreetly about John the carpenter;	Ful prively after John the carpenter;
And by chance asked a cloistered monk	And axed upon cas a cloisterer
With company, to be merry and amuse himself,	With compaignye, hym to disporte and pleye,
Upon the Monday was at Oseneye	Upon the Monday was at Oseneye
This parish clerk, this amorous Absolon,	This parissh clerk, this amorous Absolon,
And friars in the chapel began to sing.	And freres in the chauncel gonne synge.
Until the bell of the early morning service began to ring,	Til that the belle of laudes gan to rynge,
In business of mirth and of pleasure,	In bisynesse of myrthe and of solas,
And thus lie Alison and Nicholas,	And thus lith Alison and Nicholas,
There was the revel and the sounds of festivity;	Ther was the revel and the melodye;
Where the carpenter is accustomed to lie.	Ther as the carpenter is wont to lye.
Without more words they go to bed,	Withouten wordes mo they goon to bedde,
And Alisoun very quietly down she sped;	And Alisoun ful softe adoun she spedde;
And also he snores, for his head lay wrong.	And eft he routeth, for his heed myslay.
For suffering of his spirit he groans deeply,	For travaille of his goost he groneth soore,
About curfew time, or a little more;	Aboute corfew-tyme, or litel moore;
Fell on this carpenter right, as I guess,	Fil on this carpenter right, as I gesse,
The dead sleep, for weary business,	The dede sleep, for wery bisynesse,
Awaiting the rain, if he might hear it.	Awaitynge on the reyn, if he it heere.
And still he sits, and says his prayer,	And stille he sit, and biddeth his preyere,
This carpenter said his devotion,	This carpenter seyde his devocioun,
And "Quiet!" said John, and "Quiet!" said Alisoun.	And "Clom!" quod John, and "Clom!" seyde Alisoun.
They sat still a good two and one-half minutes.	They seten stille wel a furlong way.
And shortly, up they climbed all three;	And shortly, up they clomben alle thre;
And prepared everything as it should be.	And dressed alle thyng as it sholde be.
He shut his door without candlelight,	He shette his dore withoute candel-lyght,
And on the Monday, when it drew toward night,	And on the Monday, whan it drow to nyght,
Upon his business to go to London.	Upon his nede to London for to go.
He sent his servant, and also his servant girl,	He sente his knave, and eek his wenche also,
But before he had made all this preparation,	But er that he hadde maad al this array,
Sufficing just enough for a day.	Suffisynge right ynogh as for a day.
And provisioned them, both trough and tub,	And hem vitailled, bothe trogh and tubbe,
Unto the tubs hanging in the beams,	Unto the tubbes hangynge in the balkes,
To climb by the rungs and the uprights	To clymben by the ronges and the stalkes
With his own hand he made three ladders,	His owene hand he made laddres thre,
And hanged them in the roof secretly.	And heng hem in the roof in pryvetee.
And secretly he sent them to his dwelling,	And pryvely he sente hem to his in,
And after that a tub and a large vat,	And after that a tubbe and a kymelyn,
He goes and gets him a kneading trough,	He gooth and geteth hym a knedyng trogh,
He sighs with very many a sorry groan;	He siketh with ful many a sory swogh;
To drown Alisoun, his honey dear.	To drenchen Alisoun, his hony deere.
Noah's flood come surging like the sea	Noees flood come walwynge as the see
He thinks truly that he can see	Hym thynketh verraily that he may see
This hapless carpenter begins to tremble;	This sely carpenter bigynneth quake;
So deeply may a mental image be taken.	So depe may impressioun be take.
One can die of imagination,	Men may dyen of ymaginacioun,
Lo, what a great thing is emotion!	Lo, which a greet thyng is affeccioun!
Go, dear spouse, and help to save our lives."	Go, deere spouse, and help to save oure lyf."
I am thy faithful, truly wedded wife;	I am thy trewe, verray wedded wyf;
And said, "Alas! go forth thy way quickly,	And seyde, "Allas! go forth thy wey anon,
But nonetheless she acted as if she would die,	But nathelees she ferde as she wolde deye,
What all this ingenious scheme meant.	What al this queynte cast was for to seye.
And she was aware, and knew it better than he,	And she was war, and knew it bet than he,
And to his wife he told his secret,	And to his wyf he tolde his pryvetee,
Very often he said "Alas and woe is me,"	Ful ofte he seide "Allas and weylawey,"
This hapless carpenter goes forth his way.	This sely carpenter goth forth his wey.
Go, save our life, and that I beseech thee."	Go, save oure lyf, and that I the biseche."
Thou art so wise, one needs not teach thee.	Thou art so wys, it needeth thee nat teche.
To make of this any longer preaching.	To make of this no lenger sermonyng.
Go now thy way; I have no more time	Go now thy wey; I have no lenger space
And sit there, awaiting God's grace.	And sitten there, abidyng Goddes grace.
Into our kneading-tubs will we creep,	Into oure knedyng-tubbes wol we crepe,
Tomorrow at night, when people are all asleep,	Tomorwe at nyght, whan men ben alle aslepe,
This ordinance is said. Go, God give thee success!	This ordinance is seyd. Go, God thee speede!

Good morrow, I see thee well, for it is day.'	Good morwe, I se thee wel, for it is day.'
And thou will say, `Hail, master Nicholay!	And thou wolt seyn, `Hayl, maister Nicholay!

For sorrow of this he almost fell down,	For sorwe of this he fil almoost adoun,
And shall she drown? Alas, my Alisoun!"	And shal she drenche? Allas, myn Alisoun!"
This carpenter answered, "Alas, my wife!	This carpenter answerde, "Allas, my wyf!
Thus shall mankind drown, and lose their lives."	Thus shal mankynde drenche, and lese hir lyf."

For this vengeance thou shalt have therefore,	For this vengeaunce thou shalt han therfore,
And if thou tell it to anyone, thou art completely lost;	And if thou telle it man, thou art forlore;
For it is Christ's secrets that I say,	For it is Cristes conseil that I seye,
That to no person thou shalt this counsel reveal,	That to no wight thou shalt this conseil wreye,
Thou shalt upon thy pledged word swear to me here	Thou shalt upon thy trouthe swere me heere
He said, "John, my host, beloved and dear,	He seyde, "John, myn hooste, lief and deere,
And the carpenter sat down by him.	And doun the carpenter by hym he sette.
This Nicholas shut fast his door,	This Nicholas his dore faste shette,
And brought of strong ale a large quart;	And broghte of myghty ale a large quart;
This carpenter goes down, and comes again,	This carpenter goth doun, and comth ageyn,
I will tell it to no other man, certainly."	I wol telle it noon oother man, certeyn."
About a certain matter that concerns me and thee.	Of certeyn thyng that toucheth me and thee.
And after will I speak in private	And after wol I speke in pryvetee
This Nicholas answered, "Fetch me drink,	This Nicholas answerde, "Fecche me drynke,
What! Think on God, as we do, men who work."	What! Thynk on God, as we doon, men that swynke."
This carpenter answered, "What sayest thou?	This carpenter answerde, "What seystow?
Shall all the world be lost right now?"	Shal al the world be lost eftsoones now?"
And at the last this clever Nicholas	And atte laste this hende Nicholas
Where went thou, Saint Peter's sister?"	Where wentestow, Seinte Petres soster?"
For evil spirits of the nights, the white pater-noster!	For nyghtes verye, the white pater-noster!
Bless this house from every wicked creature,	Blesse this hous from every wikked wight,
"Jesus Christ and Saint Benedict,	"Jhesu Crist and Seinte Benedight,
And on the threshold of the door outside:	And on the thresshfold of the dore withoute:
On four corners of the house about,	On foure halves of the hous aboute,
Therewith the night-charm he said straightway	Therwith the nyght-spel seyde he anon-rightes
I bless thee from elves and from evil creatures."	I crouche thee from elves and fro wightes."
"What! Nicholay! What, how! What, look down!	"What! Nicholay! What, how! What, looke adoun!
And shook him hard, and cried loudly,	And shook hym harde, and cride spitously,
And seized him by the shoulders vigorously,	And hente hym by the sholdres myghtily,
This carpenter supposed he was in despair,	This carpenter wende he were in despeir,
And ever gaped upward into the air.	And evere caped upward into the eir.
This Nicholas sat ever as still as stone,	This Nicholas sat ay as stille as stoon,
Onto the floor the door fell straightway.	Into the floor the dore fil anon.
And by the hasp he heaved it off at once;	And by the haspe he haaf it of atones;
His servant was a strong fellow for this purpose,	His knave was a strong carl for the nones,
He shall (come) out of his studying, as I guess."	He shal out of his studiyng, as I gesse."
While thou, Robyn, lift up the door.	Whil that thou, Robyn, hevest up the dore.
Get me a staff, that I may pry up from below,	Get me a staf, that I may underspore,
If that I may, by Jesus, heaven's king!	If that I may, by Jhesus, hevene kyng!
He shall be scolded for his studying,	He shal be rated of his studiyng,
I feel very sorry for clever Nicholas.	Me reweth soore of hende Nicholas.
He did not see that. But yet, by Saint Thomas,	He saugh nat that. But yet, by Seint Thomas,
Until he was fallen in a fertilizer pit;	Til he was in a marle-pit yfalle;
Upon the stars, (to find) there what should happen,	Upon the sterres, what ther sholde bifalle,
So fared another clerk with astronomy;	So ferde another clerk with astromye;
Who knows nothing but only his belief!	That noght but oonly his bileve kan!
Yes, blessed be always an unlearned man	Ye, blessed be alwey a lewed man
Men should not know of God's secrets.	Men sholde nat knowe of Goddes pryvetee.
I always thought well how it should be!	I thoghte ay wel how that it sholde be!
In some madness or in some fit.	In some woodnesse or in som agonye.
This man is fallen, because of his astronomy,	This man is falle, with his astromye,
A man knows little what shall happen to him.	A man woot litel what hym shal bityde.
And said, "Help us, Saint Frideswide!	And seyde, "Help us, Seinte Frydeswyde!
In what condition he saw this same man.	In what array he saugh this ilke man.
Down he goes, and told his master immediately	Adoun he gooth, and tolde his maister soone
As if he were gazing on the new moon.	As he had kiked on the newe moone.
This Nicholas sat ever gaping upward,	This Nicholas sat evere capyng upright,
And at the last he had a sight of him.	And at the laste he hadde of hym a sight.
And through that hole he looked in very carefully,	And at that hole he looked in ful depe,
Where the cat was accustomed to creep in,	Ther as the cat was wont in for to crepe,
He found a hole, very low upon a board,	An hole he foond, ful lowe upon a bord,
But all for naught; he heard not a word.	But al for noght; he herde nat a word.
"What, hey! What do you, master Nicholay?	"What, how! What do ye, maister Nicholay?
He cried and knocked as if he were crazy,	He cride and knokked as that he were wood,
And at the chamber door while he stood,	And at the chambre dore whil that he stood,
This servant goes up very resolutely,	This knave gooth hym up ful sturdily,
Look how it is, and tell me quickly."	Looke how it is, and tel me boldely."
"Call at his door, or knock with a stone.	"Clepe at his dore, or knokke with a stoon.
"Go up," he said unto his servant at once,	"Go up," quod he unto his knave anoon,
That just now, on last Monday, I saw him work.	That now, on Monday last, I saugh hym wirche.
I saw today a corpse carried to church	I saugh today a cors yborn to chirche
God forbid that he should suddenly die!	God shilde that he deyde sodeynly!
Things are not right with Nicholas.	It stondeth nat aright with Nicholas.
And said, "I am afraid, by Saint Thomas,	And seyde, "I am adrad, by Seint Thomas,
About Nicholas, or what thing might ail him,	Of Nicholas, or what thyng myghte hym eyle,
This hapless carpenter has great marvel	This sely carpenter hath greet merveyle
Until Sunday, when the sun goes to rest.	Til Sonday, that the sonne gooth to reste.
And ate and slept, or did what he pleased,	And eet and sleep, or dide what hym leste,
That Nicholas still in his chamber lay,	That Nicholas stille in his chambre lay,
This goes on all that same Saturday,	This passeth forth al thilke Saterday,
Because, for no shout could her maid call him,	For, for no cry hir mayde koude hym calle,
She believed that he was ill,	She trowed that he was in maladye,
Of all that day she saw him not with eye;	Of al that day she saugh hym nat with ye;
She should say she knew not where he was;	She sholde seye she nyste where he was;
If he asked about Nicholas,	If that he axed after Nicholas,
And told her to say to her husband,	And to hire housbonde bad hire for to seye,
Both food and drink for a day or two,	Bothe mete and drynke for a day or tweye,
But has carried very quietly unto his chamber	But dooth ful softe unto his chambre carie
This Nicholas no longer would tarry,	This Nicholas no lenger wolde tarie,
For this was his desire and hers also.	For this was his desir and hire also.
She should sleep in his arms all night,	She sholde slepen in his arm al nyght,
And if it so be the game went right,	And if so be the game wente aright,
To beguile this hapless jealous husband;	This sely jalous housbonde to bigyle;
That Nicholas shall devise a trick	That Nicholas shal shapen hym a wyle
Are agreed on this plan,	Acorded been to this conclusioun,
And clever Nicholas and Alisoun	And hende Nicholas and Alisoun
This carpenter was gone to Osenay;	This carpenter was goon til Osenay;
And so it happened on a Saturday,	And so bifel it on a Saterday,
Now bear thyself well, thou clever Nicholas,	Now ber thee wel, thou hende Nicholas,
This nearby Nicholas cast him in the shadow.	This nye Nicholas stood in his light.
Because he was far from her sight,	By cause that he fer was from hire sight,
For though Absolon be crazed or angry,	For though that Absolon be wood or wrooth,
Makes the distant loved one to be disliked."	Maketh the ferre leeve to be looth."
Men say right thus: "Always the nearby sly one	Men seyn right thus: "Alwey the nye slye
Very true is this proverb, it is no lie,	Ful sooth is this proverbe, it is no lye,
And turns all his earnestness into a joke.	And al his ernest turneth til a jape.
And thus she makes Absolon her fool,	And thus she maketh Absolon hire ape,
That Absolon may go whistle;	That Absolon may blowe the bukkes horn;
She so loves this clever Nicholas	She loveth so this hende Nicholas
But what good does it do him in this case?	But what availleth hym as in this cas?
He plays Herod upon a high stage.	He pleyeth Herodes upon a scaffold hye.
Sometimes, to show his agility and skill,	Somtyme, to shewe his lightnesse and maistrye,
And some by force, and some for noble character.	And somme for strokes, and somme for gentillesse.
For some folk will be won for riches,	For som folk wol ben wonnen for richesse,
And, because she was a townie, he offered money;	And, for she was of town, he profred meede;
And wafers, piping hot out of the fire;	And wafres, pipyng hoot out of the gleede;
He sings, trilling like a nightingale;	He syngeth, brokkynge as a nyghtyngale;
And swore he would be her own servant;	And swoor he wolde been hir owene page;
He woos her by go-betweens and agents,	He woweth hire by meenes and brocage,
He combs his flowing locks, and dressed himself elegantly;	He kembeth his lokkes brode, and made hym gay;
He stays awake all the night and all the day;	He waketh al the nyght and al the day;
So woos her that he is in a sorry state.	So woweth hire that hym is wo bigon.
From day to day this elegant Absolon	Fro day to day this joly Absolon
This goes on; what more would you have?	This passeth forth; what wol ye bet than weel?
"Yes indeed, God knows, John, I hear it every bit."	"Yis, God woot, John, I heere it every deel."
That chants thus next to our bedroom's wall?"	That chaunteth thus under oure boures wal?"
"What! Alison! Hearest thou not Absolon,	"What! Alison! Herestow nat Absolon,
And spoke unto his wife, and said at once,	And spak unto his wyf, and seyde anon,
This carpenter awoke, and heard him sing,	This carpenter awook, and herde him synge,
Very well in harmony with his guitar-playing.	Ful wel acordaunt to his gyternynge.
I pray yow that you will have pity on me,"	I praye yow that ye wole rewe on me,"
"Now, dear lady, if it be thy will,	"Now, deere lady, if thy wille be,
He sings in his voice gentle and high,	He syngeth in his voys gentil and smal,
That was upon the carpenter's wall.	That was upon the carpenteris wal.
A little after cocks had crowed,	A litel after cokkes hadde ycrowe,
Until he came to the carpenter's house	Til he cam to the carpenteres hous
And forth he goes, elegant and amorous,	And forth he gooth, jolif and amorous,
For the sake of love he intended to stay awake.	For paramours he thoghte for to wake.
And Absolon his guitar has taken;	And Absolon his gyterne hath ytake;
The moon, when it was night, very brightly shone,	The moone, whan it was nyght, ful brighte shoon,
For courtesy, he said, he would have none.	For curteisie, he seyde, he wolde noon.
That of no wife took he any offering;	That of no wyf took he noon offrynge;
Has in his heart such a love-longing	Hath in his herte swich a love-longynge
And he a cat, he would have grabbed her at once.	And he a cat, he wolde hire hente anon.
I dare well say, if she had been a mouse,	I dar wel seyn, if she hadde been a mous,
She was so attractive and sweet and flirtatious.	She was so propre and sweete and likerous.
To look on her he thought a merry life,	To looke on hire hym thoughte a myrie lyf,
And especially on this carpenter's wife.	And namely on this carpenteris wyf.
And many a lovely look he cast on them,	And many a lovely look on hem he caste,
Censing the wives of the parish eagerly;	Sensynge the wyves of the parisshe faste;
Goes with a censer on the holiday,	Gooth with a sencer on the haliday,
This Absolon, who was elegant and gay,	This Absolon, that jolif was and gay,
But to say the truth, he was somewhat squeamish	But sooth to seyn, he was somdeel squaymous
Where any merry barmaid was.	Ther any gaylard tappestere was.
That he did not visit with his entertainment,	That he ne visited with his solas,
In all the town there was no brew house nor tavern	In al the toun nas brewhous ne taverne
And he could play as well on a guitar.	And as wel koude he pleye on a giterne.
To which he some times sang a loud high treble;	Therto he song som tyme a loud quynyble;
And play songs on a small fiddle,	And pleyen songes on a smal rubible;
And with his legs kick to and fro,	And with his legges casten to and fro,
After the school of Oxford as it was then,	After the scole of Oxenforde tho,
And make a charter of land or a legal release.	And maken a chartre of lond or acquitaunce.
Well could he draw blood, and cut hair and shave,	Wel koude he laten blood, and clippe and shave,
A merry lad he was, so save me God.	A myrie child he was, so God me save.
As white as is the blossom upon the branch.	As whit as is the blosme upon the rys.
And over that he had a gay surplice	And therupon he hadde a gay surplys
Very fair and thick are the laces set.	Ful faire and thikke been the poyntes set.
All in a tunic of a light blue;	Al in a kirtel of a lyght waget;
Clad he was very trimly and properly	Yclad he was ful smal and proprely
In red hose he went elegantly.	In hoses rede he wente fetisly.
His complexion was ruddy, his eyes gray as a goose.	His rode was reed, his eyen greye as goos.
Very straight and even lay his elegant parted hair.	Ful streight and evene lay his joly shode.
And stretched out like a fan large and broad;	And strouted as a fanne large and brode;
Curly was his hair, and as the gold it shone,	Crul was his heer, and as the gold it shoon,
Who was called Absolon.	The which that was ycleped Absolon.
Now was there of that church a parish clerk,	Now was ther of that chirche a parissh clerk,
It was so washed when she left her work.	So was it wasshen whan she leet hir werk.
Her forehead shone as bright as any day,	Hir forheed shoon as bright as any day,
This good wife went on a holiday.	This goode wyf went on an haliday.
Then it thus happened, that to the parish church,	Thanne fil it thus, that to the paryssh chirche,
And plays fast, and makes melody.	And pleyeth faste, and maketh melodie.
He kissed her sweetly and takes his psaltery,	He kiste hire sweete and taketh his sawtrie,
And well patted her about the loins,	And thakked hire aboute the lendes weel,
When Nicholas had done thus every bit	Whan Nicholas had doon thus everideel
To wait for a time, as I have told before.	To wayte a tyme, as I have told biforn.
And thus they are agreed and sworn	And thus they been accorded and ysworn

And swore her oath, by Saint Thomas of Kent,	And swoor hir ooth, by Seint Thomas of Kent,
That she granted him her love at the last,	That she hir love hym graunted atte laste,
And spoke so fair, and pressed his suit so fast,	And spak so faire, and profred him so faste,
Take away your hands, for your courtesy!"	Do wey youre handes, for youre curteisye!"

And said, "I will not kiss thee, by my faith!	And seyde, "I wol nat kisse thee, by my fey!
And with her head she twisted fast away,	And with hir heed she wryed faste awey,
And she sprang as a colt does when restrained,	And she sproong as a colt dooth in the trave,
Or I will die, so save me God!"	Or I wol dyen, also God me save!"

And also people should not take a joke too seriously.	And eek men shal nat maken ernest of game.
Think about this, and don't blame me;	Avyseth yow, and put me out of blame;
And ribaldry they told, both of the two.	And harlotrie they tolden bothe two.
So was the Reeve also and many others,	So was the Reve eek and othere mo,
The Miller is a churl; you know this well.	The Millere is a cherl; ye knowe wel this.
Blame not me if you choose amiss.	Blameth nat me if that ye chese amys.

A husband must not be inquisitive	An housbonde shal nat been inquisityf
I will believe well that I am not one.	I wol bileve wel that I am noon.
As to believe of myself that I were one (a cuckold);	As demen of myself that I were oon;
Take upon me more than enough (trouble),	Take upon me moore than ynogh,

"Now listen," said the Miller, "everyone!	"Now herkneth," quod the Millere, "alle and some!
Thou art a fool; thy wit is overcome."	Thou art a fool; thy wit is overcome."
Our Host answered, "Tell on, in the devil's name!	Oure Hoost answerde, "Tel on, a devel wey!
For I will speak or else go my way."	For I wol speke or elles go my wey."
"By God's soul," said he, "that will not I;	"By Goddes soule," quod he, "that wol nat I;

But in Pilate's voice he began to cry,	But in Pilates voys he gan to crie,

So that he hardly sat upon his horse,	So that unnethe upon his hors he sat,
The Miller, who for drunkenness was all pale,	The Millere, that for dronken was al pale,
Now tell you, sir Monk, if you can,	Now telleth ye, sir Monk, if that ye konne,
For truly the game is well begun.	For trewely the game is wel bigonne.
Let's see now who shall tell another tale;	Lat se now who shal telle another tale;
This goes well; the bag is opened.	This gooth aright; unbokeled is the male.
Our Host laughed and swore, "As I may move about (I swear),	Oure Hooste lough and swoor, "So moot I gon,

Hanged was Cresus, the proud king;	Anhanged was Cresus, the proude kyng;
Thus warned him very bluntly and also very plainly	Thus warned hym ful plat and ek ful pleyn
Rain shall thee wash, and sun shall thee dry."	Reyn shal thee wasshe, and sonne shal thee drye."

"The tree," said she, "is to signify the gallows,	"The tree," quod she, "the galwes is to meene,
And she began right thus to expound his dream:	And she his dreem bigan right thus expounde:
He bad her tell him what it signified,	He bad hire telle hym what it signyfyde,
And to his daughter, who stood him beside,	And to his doghter, that stood hym bisyde,
To dry himself with; and therefore his pride grew,	To dryen hym with; and therfore wax his pryde,
And Phoebus also brought him a fair towel	And Phebus eek a fair towaille hym broughte
Where Jupiter washed him, both back and side,	Ther Juppiter hym wessh, bothe bak and syde,
Upon a tree he was, as it seemed to him,	Upon a tree he was, as that hym thoughte,
That in vengeance he set all his heart.	That in vengeance he al his herte sette.
Of which he was so proud and also so pleased	Of which he was so proud and eek so fayn
And also a dream upon one night he dreamed,	And eek a sweven upon a nyght he mette,
That of his foes he could not be slain;	That of his foos he myghte nat be slayn;
He well believed, because Fortune sent him	He wende wel, for that Fortune hym sente

When he had escaped, he can not stop	Whanne he escaped was, he kan nat stente
Until Fortune on the gallows made him gape.	Til Fortune on the galwes made hym gape.
But to be wary (of Fortune) no grace yet he had,	But to be war no grace yet he hadde,
That killed the fire, and allowed him to escape;	That slow the fyr, and made hym to escape;
But such a rain down from the sky poured	But swich a reyn doun fro the welkne shadde
And to be burned men led him to the fire.	And to be brent men to the fyr hym ladde.

Of decency yet had he remembrance.	Of honestee yet hadde he remembraunce.
And knew truly that he was dead,	And wiste verraily that deed was hee,
And as he lay a-dying in a trance,	And as he lay of diyng in a traunce,
So that no man should see his private parts;	For no man sholde seen his privetee;
His mantle over his hips cast he,	His mantel over his hypes caste he,
That though his deadly wounds sorely pained,	That though his deedly woundes soore smerte,
And so well loved dignified decency,	And so wel lovede estaatly honestee,
So manly was this Julius of heart,	So manly was this Julius of herte,
Or else at two, unless his history lies.	Or elles at two, but if his storie lye.

This Julius to the Capitol went	This Julius to the Capitolie wente
With daggers, as I shall tell you.	With boydekyns, as I shal yow devyse.

Alas, Pompey, of the east conqueror,	Allas, Pompeye, of th' orient conquerour,
Of Julius, and he brought him the head.	Of Julius, and hym the heed he broghte.

This Pompey, this noble governor	This Pompeus, this noble governour
But now for a little while I will bewail	But now a litel while I wol biwaille
Thank Fortune, that so well helped thee to succeed!	Thanke Fortune, that so wel thee spedde!
Through which thou puttest all the east in awe.	Thurgh which thou puttest al th' orient in awe.
Save for a few folk that fled with Pompey,	Save fewe folk that with Pompeus fledde,
Thou through thy knighthood hast them taken and slain,	Thou thurgh thy knyghthod hast hem take and slawe,
As far as where the day begins to dawn,	As fer as that the day bigynneth dawe,

So full was his disposition of high knightly prowess.	So ful was his corage of heigh emprise.
And yet it seemed to him it might not suffice?	And yet hym thoughte it myghte nat suffise?

The death of nobility and of magnanimity,	The deeth of gentillesse and of franchise,
Who shall give me tears to complain	Who shal me yeven teeris to compleyne
And for thee she wept never a tear.	And for thee ne weep she never a teere.

Who first was king in the country of Greece.	That first was kyng in Grece the contree.
He was the son of Philip of Macedonia,	Philippes sone of Macidoyne he was,
Twelve years he reigned, as says Maccabees.	Twelf yeer he regned, as seith Machabee.
About his knighthood, it could not suffice.	Of his knyghthod, it myghte nat suffise.
For though I should write or told you evermore	For though I write or tolde yow everemo

What honor were it to him, though I you told	What pris were it to hym, though I yow tolde
So was he full of leonine courage.	So was he ful of leonyn corage.
His noble ambition in arms and struggles,	His hye entente in armes and labour,
Save wine and women, no thing might assuage	Save wyn and wommen, no thing myghte aswage
Fortune made him the heir of her honor.	Fortune hym made the heir of hire honour.
He was flower of knighthood and of nobility;	He was of knyghthod and of fredom flour;
For all this world for dread of him has trembled.	For al this world for drede of hym hath quaked.
Comparison might never yet be made	Comparisoun myghte nevere yet been maked
Wherever he came, unto the world's end.	Wherso he cam, unto the worldes ende.
The pride of man and beast he laid low,	The pride of man and beest he leyde adoun,
They were glad to send unto him (to sue) for peace .	They weren glad for pees unto hym sende.
He won by strength, or for his high renown	He wan by strengthe, or for his hye renoun
This wide world, in the end,	This wyde world, as in conclusioun,
Has heard something or all of his fortune.	Hath herd somwhat or al of his fortune.
That every person who has good judgment	That every wight that hath discrecioun

Such reward as belongs to pride.	Swich gerdoun as bilongeth unto pryde.
That many a man made to weep and mourn,	That many a man made to wepe and pleyne,
Thus has this robber and this homicide,	Thus hath this robbour and this homycide,
He died very wretchedly on a mountain.	He starf ful wrecchedly in a monteyne.
And in this stink and this horrible pain,	And in this stynk and this horrible peyne,
No man could bear him in any way.	No man ne myghte hym bere to ne fro.
Full loathsome was the stink of his decaying body;	Ful wlatsom was the stynk of his careyne;
To all his host and to himself also	To al his hoost and to hymself also
And acknowledged God lord of every creature.	And knew God lord of every creature.
Could not endure the stink of him.	Ne myghte noght the stynk of hym endure.
Whether he stayed awake or else slept,	Wheither so he wook or ellis slepte,
That no one of all his household that served him,	That noon of al his meynee that hym kepte,
And in addition to all that he stank so horribly	And therwithal he stank so horribly
That through his body wicked worms crept,	That thurgh his body wikked wormes crepte,
The vengeance of God smote him so cruelly	The wreche of God hym smoot so cruelly
All badly bruised, both back and side.	Al forbrused, bothe bak and syde.
But in a sedan chair men carried him about,	But in a chayer men aboute hym bar,
So that he might neither walk nor ride,	So that he neyther myghte go ne ryde,
For he so sorely fell out of his throne	For he so soore fil out of his char
God laid low all his pride and all his boast.	God daunted al his pride and al his boost.
And suddenly, before he was aware of it,	And sodeynly, er he was of it war,
But commanded straightway to prepare his host;	But bad anon apparaillen his hoost;
For all his pain, he would not restrain himself,	For al his smert, he wolde hym nat restreyne,
But from his cursed and damnable purpose,	But from his purpos cursed and dampnable,
For many a man's gut did he pain.	For many a mannes guttes dide he peyne.
And certainly the punishment was reasonable,	And certeinly the wreche was resonable,
That his pains were intolerable.	That his peynes weren importable.
With invisible wound, ever incurable,	With invisible wounde, ay incurable,
God because of his threatening so sorely smote him	God for his manace hym so soore smoot
But of his purpose he was prevented very soon.	But of his purpos he was let ful soone.
To wreak his ire on it very cruelly;	To wreken his ire on it ful cruelly;
Unto Jerusalem he would (go) immediately	Unto Jerusalem he wolde eftsoone
And swore, and said very angrily	And swoor, and seyde ful despitously
That he ordered his chariot prepared very hastily,	That he bad greithen his chaar ful hastily,
Unto the Jews such a hate had he	Unto the Jewes swich an hate hadde he
By Jews were vanquished completely,	Of Jewes weren venquysshed myghtily,
Supposing that God could not reduce his pride.	Wenynge that God ne myghte his pride abate.
Them he would slay in torment and in pain,	Hem wolde he sleen in torment and in payne,
And God's people had he most in hate;	And Goddes peple hadde he moost in hate;
And all the floods of the sea restrain.	And alle the floodes of the see restrayne.
And in a scales weigh each mountain,	And in balance weyen ech montayne,
Unto the stars upon every side,	Unto the sterres upon every syde,
That truly he supposed he might attain	That verraily he wende he myghte attayne
Fortune had elevated him so in pride	Fortune hym hadde enhaunced so in pride
And on a hill how wretchedly he died.	And in an hill how wrecchedly he deyde.
And read the proud words that he said,	And rede the proude wordes that he seyde,
Read who he was in Maccabees,	Rede which that he was in Machabee,
For such another was there no one like him.	For swich another was ther noon as he.

Very secretly she stole (away) from every person,	Ful pryvely she stal from every wight,

And yet, for all his pomp and all his might,	And yet, for al his pompe and al his myght,
Within his tent, large as is a barn,	Withinne his tente, large as is a berne,
Amid his host he lay drunk at night,	Amydde his hoost he dronke lay a-nyght,
But take heed of the death of Holofernes:	But taak kep of the deth of Oloferne:
Where Eliachim (Joachim) was a priest of that place.	Where Eliachim a preest was of that place.
Save in Bethulia, a strong city,	Save in Bethulia, a strong citee,
Against his command no person dared trespass,	Agayns his heeste no wight dorst trespace,

But he made every man renounce his religion.	But he made every man reneyen his lawe.
For (fear of) loss of riches or liberty,	For lesynge of richesse or libertee,
Not only that this world had him in awe	Nat oonly that this world hadde hym in awe
Until his head was off, before he knew it.	Til that his heed was of, er that he wiste.
So wantonly, and led him up and down	So likerously, and ladde hym up and doun
Than Holofernes, whom Fortune always kissed	Than Oloferne, which Fortune ay kiste
Nor more arrogant in high presumption	Ne moore pompous in heigh presumpcioun
In his time, nor greater of renown,	As in his tyme, ne gretter of renoun,
Nor was stronger in all things concerning the field of battle,	Ne strenger was in feeld of alle thyng,
Was never captain under a king	Was nevere capitayn under a kyng

About which Fortune laughed, and amused herself.	Of which Fortune lough, and hadde a game.
Himself he slew, he knew no better course of action,	Hymself he slow, he koude no bettre reed,
No insult was done for his ill fame.	Were no despit ydoon for his defame.
So that to his body, when he was deed,	That to his body, whan that he were deed,
To slay him and to strike off his head,	To sleen hym and to girden of his heed,
And to these two churls he did pray	And to thise cherles two he gan to preye
That sat by a fire, great and red.	That seten by a fyr, greet and reed.
And he ran into a garden to hide himself.	And ran into a gardyn hym to hyde.
For dread of this it seemed to him that he died,	For drede of this hym thoughte that he deyde,
For help, but it could not happen.	For socour, but it myghte nat bityde.
And to his gods pitiably he prayed	And to his goddes pitously he preyde
For fear almost out of his wit he went,	For fere almoost out of his wit he breyde,
"Where is this false tyrant, this Nero?"	"Where is this false tiraunt, this Neroun?"
That with his ears he heard how they said,	That with his erys herde he how they seyde,
The people cried and made a tumult up and down,	The peple cried and rombled up and doun,
And went his way; no longer dared he call.	And wente his wey; no lenger dorste he calle.
The tighter they shut all the doors.	The fastere shette they the dores alle.
He knocked fast, and always the more he cried	He knokked faste, and ay the moore he cried
Alone, and where he supposed to have been allied	Allone, and ther he wende han been allied
Out of his doors right away he has hastened himself	Out of his dores anon he hath hym dight
For his wickedness, and when he espied it,	For his defaute, and whan he it espied,
The people rose upon him on one night	The peple roos upon hym on a nyght
When he least expects it, the most quickly shall he fall."	Whan he leest weneth, sonnest shal he falle."
By God, out of his throne I will snatch him;	By God, out of his sete I wol hym trice;
In high degree, and call him emperor.	In heigh degree, and emperour hym calle.
She thought thus: "By God! I am too foolish	She thoughte thus: "By God! I am to nyce
For though he may be strong, yet was she stronger.	For though that he were strong, yet was she strenger.

And thus has Nero slain his dear master.	And thus hath Nero slayn his maister deere.
Rather than have another form of torment;	Rather than han another tormentise;
Chose in a bath to die in this manner	Chees in a bath to dye in this manere
But nonetheless this Seneca the wise	But natheless this Seneca the wise
Therefore he made him die in this manner.	Therefore he made hym dyen in this wise.
In youth to rise in the presence of his master ,	In youthe agayns his maister for to ryse,
This Nero had also the custom	This Nero hadde eek of acustumaunce
On both his arms, until he had to die.	On bothe his armes, til he moste dye.
For which he in a bath made him to bleed	For which he in a bath made hym to blede
Be virtuous and hate tyranny --"	Be vertuous and hate tirannye --"
"Sire," would he say, "an emperor must of necessity	"Sire," wolde he seyn, "an emperour moot nede
Discreetly, as by word and not by deed --	Discreetly, as by word and nat by dede --
For he would always chastise him from vices	For he fro vices wolde hym ay chastise
Because Nero had of him such dread,	By cause Nero hadde of hym swich drede,
Or any vice dared unloose itself upon him.	Or any vice dorste on hym uncowple.
That long time it was before tyranny	That longe tyme it was er tirannye
He made him so cunning and so humble	He maked hym so konnyng and so sowple
And while this master had of him mastery,	And whil this maister hadde of hym maistrye,
In his time, unless books lie;	As in his tyme, but if bookes lye;
For of morality he was the flower,	For of moralitee he was the flour,
To teach him literature and courtesy,	To teche hym letterure and curteisye,
In youth this emperor had a master	In yowthe a maister hadde this emperour
Alas, too deep will the venom go!	Allas, to depe wol the venym wade!
And drank straightway -- no other mourning he made.	And drank anon -- noon oother wo he made.
He commanded that the wine be brought to him ,	The wyn to bryngen hym comanded he,
Be judge of her dead beauty.	Be domesman of hire dede beautee.
Great wonder is how that he could or might	Greet wonder is how that he koude or myghte
Came, but he said, "A fair woman was she!"	Ne cam, but seyde, "A fair womman was she!"
No tear out of his eyes for that sight	No teere out of his eyen for that sighte
That he reckoned so little of his mother!	That he so litel of his mooder tolde!
Where he was conceived -- so woe oh woe	Where he conceyved was -- so weilaway
For he slit her womb to behold	For he hire wombe slitte to biholde
And slew his brother, and by his sister lay.	And slow his brother, and by his suster lay.
To hear how men would weep and cry;	To heere how that men wolde wepe and crie;
The senators he slew upon one day	The senatours he slow upon a day
He burned Rome for his pleasure;	He Rome brende for his delicasie;
For Fortune as his friend would obey him.	For Fortune as his freend hym wolde obeye.
His desires were all lawful in his legal code,	His lustes were al lawe in his decree,
To fish in Tiber, when he wished to amuse himself.	To fisshe in Tybre, whan hym liste pleye.
Nets of gold thread had he in great plenty	Nettes of gold threed hadde he greet plentee
After that time he wanted never to see it.	After that tyme he nolde it nevere see.
More proud than he was never emperor;	Moore proud was nevere emperour than he;
More fond of luxury, more pompous in behavior,	Moore delicaat, moore pompous of array,
For he in gems greatly did delight.	For he in gemmes greetly gan delite.
Were all his clothes embroidered from head to toe,	Were alle his clothes brouded up and doun,
Of rubies, sapphires, and of white pearls	Of rubies, saphires, and of peerles white
Both east and west, [south], and north.	Bothe est and west, [south], and septemtrioun.
Had this wide world in subjection,	This wyde world hadde in subjeccioun,
Yet he, as Suetonius tells us,	Yet he, as telleth us Swetonius,
As any fiend that lies very low down (in Hell),	As any feend that lith ful lowe adoun,

Redeth the grete poete of Ytaille	Whoever wants to hear it in a longer version,
Whoso wol here it in a lenger wise,	Of this tragedy it ought enough suffice;
Of this tragedie it oghte ynough suffise;	From high estate Fortune cut him away.
From heigh estaat Fortune awey hym carf.	Thus ended is this mighty Earl of Pisa.
Thus ended is this myghty Erl of Pize.	Himself, despaired, also for hunger died;
Hymself, despeired, eek for hunger starf;	They laid themselves down in his lap and died.
And after that, withinne a day or two,	And eat enough" -- right thus they to him said,
And ete ynogh" -- right thus they to hym seyde,	Our flesh thou gave us, take our flesh from us,
Oure flessh thou yaf us, take oure flessh us fro,	But rather eat the flesh upon us two.
But rather ete the flessh upon us two.	And said, "Father, do not so, alas!
And seyde, "Fader, do nat so, allas!	That he gnawed on his arms, and not for woe,
That he his armes gnow, and nat for wo,	His children supposed that it was for hunger
His children wende that it for hunger was	I can blame thy false wheel for all my woe."
Thy false wheel my wo al may I wyte."	And said, "Alas, Fortune, and woe oh woe!
And seyde, "Allas, Fortune, and weylaway!	For woe his two arms he began to bite,
And whan the woful fader deed it say,	And kissed his father, and died the same day.
And kiste his fader, and dyde the same day.	And said, "Farewell, father, I must die!"
And seyde, "Farewel, fader, I moot dye!"	Until in his father's bosom down it lay,
Til in his fadres barm adoun it lay,	Thus day by day this child began to cry,
Thus day by day this child bigan to crye,	There is nothing, but food, that I would rather have."
Ther is no thyng, but breed, that me were levere."	Then hunger should not creep in my belly;
Thanne sholde nat hunger in my wombe crepe;	Now would God that I might sleep forever!
Now wolde God that I myghte slepen evere!	I am so hungry that I can not sleep.
I am so hungry that I may nat slepe.	Is there no morsel of bread that you do keep?
Whanne wol the gayler bryngen oure potage?	Unto him said, "Father, why do you weep?
Unto hym seyde, "Fader, why do ye wepe?	His young son, who was three years of age,
His yonge sone, that thre yeer was of age,	Therewith the tears fell from his eyes.
Therwith the teeris fillen from his yen.	"Alas!" said he, "Alas, that I was wrought!"
"Allas!" quod he, "Allas, that I was wroght!"	That they for hunger would make him die.

So doghty was hir housbonde and eek she,	And shortly of this history to treat,
And shortly of this storie for to trete,	How she in virtue might spend her life.
How she in vertu myghte hir lyf dispende.	To learn books was all her desire,
To lerne bookes was al hire likyng,	When she had leisure; and to endeavor
To have of sondry tonges ful knowyng,	And also she did not neglect, for any hunting,
And eek she lafte noght, for noon huntyng,	She was all clad in precious stones and in gold,
She was al clad in perree and in gold,	As well in utensils as in her clothing.
As wel in vessel as in hire clothyng.	Her rich furnishings could not be told,
Hir riche array ne myghte nat be told,	Was none, though through all this world men should seek.
Was noon, though al this world men sholde seke.	Nor more labor could in war endure,
Ne moore labour myghte in werre endure,	So assiduous in the war, and courtly also,
So penyble in the werre, and curteis eke,	And wise also, and generous in moderation,
And wys therwith, and large with mesure,	I say, so worshipful a creature,
But now unto oure tale turne we.	Whom she kept in virtue and learning.
The whiche she kepte in vertu and lettrure.	Two sons by this Odenake had she,
Two sones by this Odenake hadde she,	In any other case, if men had sexual relations with them.
In oother caas, if that men with hem pleyde.	It was to wives lechery and shame,
It was to wyves lecherie and shame,	He got no more of her, for thus she said:
He gat namoore of hire, for thus she seyde:	Even if this Odenake were wild or tame,
Al were this Odenake wilde or tame,	Then would she once allow him to do the same.
Thanne wolde she ones suffre hym do the same.	Until fully forty weeks were past;
Til fully fourty wikes weren past;	No more should he play that same game
And if she were with childe at thilke cast,	Again, and only but once, no doubt.
Eft-soone, and nat but oones, out of drede.	Then would she allow him to do his desires
Thanne wolde she suffre hym doon his fantasye	That she was not with child by means of that deed,
That she was nat with childe with that dede,	And as soon as she could see
And also soone as that she myghte espye	To have a child, the world to multiply;
To have a child, the world to multiplye;	But once, for it was her full intention
But ones, for it was hir pleyn entente	In any way, that he should by her lie
By no wey, that he sholde by hire lye	Save one thing: that she would never assent,
Save o thyng: that she wolde nevere assente,	For each of them held the other beloved and dear,
They lyved in joye and in felicitee,	But nonetheless, when they were knit together,
But natheless, whan they were knyt in-feere,	Had such fantasies as had she.
Hadde swiche fantasies as hadde she.	And you must understand that he
And ye shul understonde how that he	Although it was so that she long delayed them.
Al were it so that she hem longe taried.	To Odenake, a prince of that country,
To Odenake, a prynce of that contree,	But at the last her friends have married her
But atte laste hir freendes han hire maried	She disdained to be bound to no man.
To no man deigned hire for to be bonde.	She kept her maidenhead from every person;
She kepte hir maydenhod from every wight;	There might no thing withstand her arms.
With any yong man, were he never so wight.	Wrestle, by sheer force and sheer strength,
Wrastlen, by verray force and verray myght,	And to sleep under a bush, and she could also
And slepen under a bussh, and she koude eke	And to run in the mountains all the night,
And rennen in the montaignes al the nyght,	She dared to seek wild beasts' dens,
She dorste wilde beestes dennes seke,	And in her arms handled them at her will.
And in hir armes weelde hem at hir wille.	Lions, leopards, and bears all torn to pieces,
Leouns, leopardes, and beres al torente,	And when she was older, she would kill
And whan that she was elder, she wolde kille	She was so swift that she quickly seized them;
She was so swift that she anon hem hente;	With broad-headed arrows that she to them sent.
And many a wilde hertes blood she shedde	Duties of women, and to the woods she went,
Office of wommen, and to wode she wente,	From her childhood I find that she fled
From hire childhede I fynde that she fledde	But of her shape she could not be improved.
But of hir shap she myghte nat been amended.	I say not that she had most beauty,
I seye nat that she hadde moost fairnesse,	Of the blood of kings of Persia is she descended.
Of kynges blood of Perce is she descended.	Nor in lineage, nor in other noble traits.
Ne in lynage, ne in oother gentillesse.	That no person passed her in boldness,
That no wight passed hire in hardynesse,	So worthy was in arms and so fierce
So worthy was in armes and so keene	As Persians write of her nobility,
Cenobia, of Palymerie queene,	Zenobia
Cenobia	This proverb is very true and very common.
This proverbe is ful sooth and ful commune.	Misfortune will make them enemies, I believe;
Mishap wol maken hem enemys, I gesse;	For whatever man who has friends because of Fortune,
For what man that hath freendes thurgh Fortune,	And also his friends, both high ranking and low.
And eek his freendes, bothe moore and lesse.	She bears away his reign and his riches,
She bereth awey his regne and his richesse,	For when Fortune will forsake a man,
For whan Fortune wole a man forsake,	How in lordship is no security,
How that in lordshipe is no sikernesse,	Gentlemen, example may you take from this
Thogh he therto hadde neither right ne lawe.	And Darius occupies his throne,
And Darius occupieth his degree,	And that same night this king was slain,
And thilke same nyght this kyng was slawe,	Given to Medes and to Persians," said he.

And slew himself, and also all his foemen.	And slow hymself, and eek his foomen alle.
And down fell temple and all, and there it lay --	And doun fil temple and al, and ther it lay --
For he shook two pillars and made them fall,	For he two pilers shook and made hem falle,
But at the last he made a terrifying assault,	But atte laste he made a foul affray,
And this was in a temple of great magnificence.	And this was in a temple of greet array.
His foemen made a feast upon one day,	His foomen made a feeste upon a day,
The end of this captive was as I shall say.	The ende of this caytyf was as I shal seye.
Since thou from prosperity art fallen into wretchedness.	Sith thou fro wele art falle in wrecchednesse.

O noble Sampson, strongest of mankind,	O noble Sampsoun, strongest of mankynde,
Where they made him grind at the mill.	Where-as they made hym at the queerne grynde.
But now is he in prison in a cave,	But now is he in prison in a cave,
There was no bond with which men could bind him;	Ther was no boond with which men myghte him bynde;
They bound him securely and put out his eyes.	They bounde hym faste and putten out his yen.
And when they found him in this condition,	And whan that they hym foond in this array,
And made his foemen know all his craft;	And made his foomen al his craft espyen;
She contrived to clip or shear his hair away,	She made to clippe or shere his heres away,
And sleeping on her bosom upon one day,	And slepynge in hir barm upon a day,
And falsely to his foemen she sold him.	And falsly to his foomen she hym solde.
That all his strength lay in his hair,	That in his heeris al his strengthe lay,
Unto his sweetheart Dalilah he told	Unto his lemman Dalida he tolde
For women shall bring him to misfortune!	For wommen shal hym bryngen to meschaunce!
He had the governance of Israel.	He hadde of Israel the governaunce.
And fully twenty winters, year by year,	And fully twenty wynter, yeer by yeere,
For all his powers were in his hair.	For alle his strengthes in his heeres weere.

For that day, he prayed him to wait.	As for that day, he preyde hym to byde.

My heart is broken; help! I am as good as dead!	Myn herte is broken; help! I nam but deed!
Awake, Symond! The fiend has fallen on me.	Awak, Symond! The feend is on me falle.
"In your hands! Lord, to Thee I call!	"In manus tuas! Lord, to thee I calle!
"Help! holy cross of Bromeholm," she said,	"Help! hooly croys of Bromeholm," she seyde,
And with the fall out of her sleep she started up.	And with the fal out of hir sleep she breyde.
With John the clerk, who had been awake all night,	With John the clerk, that waked hadde al nyght,
For she was fallen asleep a little bit	For she was falle aslepe a lite wight
And down he fell backward upon his wife,	And doun he fil bakward upon his wyf,
Until the miller stumbled on a stone,	Til that the millere sporned at a stoon,
And up they go, and down again straightway,	And up they goon, and doun agayn anon,
They wallow as do two pigs in a bag;	They walwe as doon two pigges in a poke;
And on the floor, with nose and mouth badly broken,	And in the floor, with nose and mouth tobroke,
Down ran the bloody stream upon his breast;	Doun ran the blody streem upon his brest;
And on the nose he smote him with his fist.	And on the nose he smoot hym with his fest.
And he seized him angrily in turn,	And he hente hym despitously agayn,
And by the Adam's apple he caught Alayn,	And by the throte-bolle he caughte Alayn,
Who dared be so bold to degrade	Who dorste be so boold to disparage
"Thou shalt be dead, by God's worthiness!	"Thow shalt be deed, by Goddes dignitee!
Ah, false traitor! False clerk!" said he,	A, false traitour! False clerk!" quod he,
"Yes, false scoundrel," said the miller, "hast (thou done so)?	"Ye, false harlot," quod the millere, "hast?
While thou hast, like a coward, been terrified."	Whil thow hast, as a coward, been agast."
Screwed the miller's daughter flat on her back,	Swyved the milleres doghter bolt upright,
I have three times in this short night	As I have thries in this shorte nyght
For by that lord that is called Saint James,	For by that lord that called is Seint Jame,
For Christ's soul, and hear a real joke.	For Cristes saule, and heer a noble game.
And caught him by the neck, and quietly he spoke.	And caughte hym by the nekke, and softe he spak.
And in by the miller he crept right then,	And by the millere in he creep anon,
He expected to have crept in by his fellow John,	He wende have cropen by his felawe John,
Unto the bed where the miller lay.	Unto the bed ther as the millere lay.
And forth he goes, in the name of twenty devils,	And forth he goth, a twenty devel way,
Here lies the miller and his wife also."	Heere lith the millere and his wyf also."
I know well by the cradle I have gone wrong;	I woot wel by the cradel I have mysgo;
That makes me go not right.	That makes me that I ga nat aright.
My head is dizzy from my work to-night,	Myn heed is toty of my swynk to-nyght,
And found the cradle with his hand right away.	And fond the cradel with his hand anon.
I will go creep in by my fellow,"	I wol go crepen in by my felawe,"
Aleyn up rises, and thought, "Before it dawns,	Aleyn up rist, and thoughte, "Er that it dawe,
And with that word she almost began to weep.	And with that word almoost she gan to wepe.
And, good sweetheart, God save and keep thee!"	And, goode lemman, God thee save and kepe!"
Which I helped my father to steal.	Which that I heelp my sire for to stele.
That was made of thine own meal,	That was ymaked of thyn owene mele,
Thou shalt find a cake of half a bushel	Thou shalt a cake of half a busshel fynde
Right at the entry behind the door	Right at the entree of the dore bihynde
But before thou go, one thing I will tell thee:	But er thow go, o thyng I wol thee telle:
"Now, dear sweetheart," said she, "go, farewell!	"Now, deere lemman," quod she, "go, far weel!
I am thine own clerk, as I may prosper!"	I is thyn awen clerk, swa have I seel!"
But evermore, wherever I walk or ride,	But everemo, wher so I go or ryde,
The day is come; I may no longer remain here;	The day is come; I may no lenger byde;
And said, "Farewell, Malyne, sweet creature!	And seyde, "Fare weel, Malyne, sweete wight!
For he had labored all the long night,	For he had swonken al the longe nyght,
Aleyn grew weary at the time of dawn,	Aleyn wax wery in the dawenynge,
Until the third cock began to sing (an hour before dawn).	Til that the thridde cok bigan to synge.
He stabs hard and deep as if he were mad.	He priketh harde and depe as he were mad.
She had not had so merry an experience for a long time;	So myrie a fit ne hadde she nat ful yoore;
And on this good wife he lays on vigorously.	And on this goode wyf he leith on soore.
Within a moment this John the clerk leaped up,	Withinne a while this John the clerk up leep,
And lies full still, and would have gone to sleep.	And lith ful stille, and wolde han caught a sleep.
But gently she crept in to the clerk,	But faire and wel she creep in to the clerk,
And did not know where she was, for it was dark;	And nyste wher she was, for it was derk;
Because the cradle by it stood,	By cause that the cradel by it stood,
And found the bed, and thought all was well,	And foond the bed, and thoghte noght but good,
And forth she goes until she found the cradle.	And forth she gooth til she the cradel fond.
Ay, bless me! Then I would have made a mess of it!"	Ey, benedicite! Thanne hadde I foule ysped!"
I had almost gone to the clerks' bed.	I hadde almoost goon to the clerkes bed.
"Alas!" said she, "I had almost gone wrong;	"Allas!" quod she, "I hadde almoost mysgoon;
And groped here and there, but she found none.	And groped heer and ther, but she foond noon.
And came back, and began to miss her cradle,	And cam agayn, and gan hir cradel mysse,
And awoke, and went out to piss,	And gan awake, and wente hire out to pisse,
Soon after this the wife stopped her snoring,	Soone after this the wyf hir rowtyng leet,
And carried it quietly to the foot of his bed.	And baar it softe unto his beddes feet.
And up he rose, and quietly he went	And up he roos, and softely he wente
`The timid one is unlucky,' thus people say."	`Unhardy is unseely,' thus men sayth."
I will arise and chance it, by my faith!	I wil arise and auntre it, by my fayth!
I shall be considered a fool, a weakling!	I sal been halde a daf, a cokenay!
And when this trick is told another day,	And when this jape is tald another day,
And I lie like a sack of rubbish in my bed;	And I lye as a draf-sak in my bed;
He took a risk, and has accomplished his purpose,	He auntred hym, and has his nedes sped,
He has the miller's daughter in his arm.	He has the milleris doghter in his arm.
Yet has my fellow something for his harm;	Yet has my felawe somwhat for his harm;
"Alas!" said he, "this is a wicked trick;	"Allas!" quod he, "this is a wikked jape;
And to himself he laments and feels sorry.	And to hymself he maketh routhe and wo.
This John lies still five minutes or so,	This John lith stille a furlong wey or two,
Now play, Aleyn, for I will speak of John.	Now pley, Aleyn, for I wol speke of John.
And shortly to speak, they were together.	And shortly for to seyn, they were aton.
It was too late to cry out,	That it had been to late for to crie,
Until he was so near, before she could see him,	Til he so ny was, er she myghte espie,
This wench lay on her back and fast slept,	This wenche lay uprighte and faste slepte,
And up he rises, and by the wench he crept.	And up he rist, and by the wenche he crepte.
He might do injury to us both."	He myghte doon us bathe a vileynye."
"And if he out of his sleep suddenly awoke,	"And gif that he out of his sleep abreyde,
The miller is a perilous man," he said,	The millere is a perilous man," he seyde,
This John answered, "Alayn, be careful!	This John answerde, "Alayn, avyse thee!
By God's soul, it shall be no other way!"	By Goddes sale, it sal neen other bee!"
For my loss, I will have satisfaction.	Agayn my los, I will have esement.
And since I shall have no recompense	And syn I sal have neen amendement
And we have had a hard time all this day;	And we han had an il fit al this day;
Our grain is stolen, truly, it can not be denied,	Oure corn is stoln, sothly, it is na nay,
That if a man in one point is injured,	That gif a man in a point be agreved,
For, John, there is a law that says thus:	For, John, ther is a lawe that says thus:
Some redress the law has shaped for us,	Som esement has lawe yshapen us,
If I can, yon wench will I screw.	If that I may, yon wenche wil I swyve.
For, John," said he, "as ever I may thrive,	For, John," seyde he, "als evere moot I thryve,
But yet, no matter, all shall be for the best.	But yet, na fors, al sal be for the beste.
This long night there comes to me no sleep;	This lange nyght ther tydes me na reste;
Yes, they shall have the best (i.e., the worst) of a bad ending.	Ye, they sal have the flour of il endyng.
Who heard ever such an amazing thing?	Wha herkned evere slyk a ferly thyng?
Lo, such a compline (evening service) is made by them all;	Lo, swilk a complyn is ymel hem alle;
Heardest thou ever such a song before now?	Herdestow evere slyk a sang er now?
He poked John, and said, "Sleepest thou?	He poked John, and seyde, "Slepestow?
Aleyn the clerk, who heard this melody,	Aleyn the clerk, that herde this melodye,
The wench snores also, to keep them company.	The wenche rowteth eek, par compaignye.
One could hear their snoring two furlongs away;	Men myghte hir rowtyng heere two furlong;
His wife bore him a bass accompaniment, very loud;	His wyf bar hym a burdon, a ful strong;
And of his tail behind he took no heed.	Ne of his tayl bihynde he took no keep.
That he snorts like a horse in his sleep,	That as an hors he fnorteth in his sleep,
There was no more -- they needed no sleeping potion.	Ther nas na moore -- hem nedede no dwale.
To bed goes Aleyn and also John;	To bedde goth Aleyn and also John;
To bed went the daughter right away;	To bedde wente the doghter right anon;
And when all that was in the crock was drunk,	And whan that dronken al was in the crowke,
To rock, and to give the child to suck.	To rokken, and to yeve the child to sowke.
The cradle at her bed's feet is set,	The cradel at hir beddes feet is set,
So was her jolly whistle well wetted.	So was hir joly whistle wel ywet.
She was as cheerful and jolly as any jay,	As any jay she light was and jolyf,
To bed he goes, and with him goes his wife.	To bedde he goth, and with hym goth his wyf.
He belches, and he speaks through the nose	He yexeth, and he speketh thurgh the nose
Full pale he was for drunkenness, and not red.	Ful pale he was for dronken, and nat reed.
Well has this miller varnished his head (drank heavily);	Wel hath this millere vernysshed his heed;
About midnight they went to bed.	Aboute mydnyght wente they to reste.
And drink ever strong ale of the best quality.	And drynken evere strong ale atte beste.
They sup and they converse, to entertain themselves,	They soupen and they speke, hem to solace,
There was no larger lodging in the place.	Ther was no roumer herberwe in the place.
It could be no better, and (do you know) the cause why?	It myghte be no bet, and cause why?
Right in the same chamber side by side.	Right in the same chambre by and by.
Not ten feet or twelve from his own bed.	Noght from his owene bed ten foot or twelve.
With sheets and with blankets nicely spread	With sheetes and with chalons faire yspred
And in his own bedroom made them a bed,	And in his owene chambre hem made a bed,
And tied up their horse, it should no more go loose,	And boond hire hors, it sholde namoore go loos,
For ale and bread, and roasted them a goose,	For ale and breed, and rosted hem a goos,
This miller into town his daughter sent	This millere into toun his doghter sende
Lo, here is our silver, ready to spend."	Loo, heere oure silver, redy for to spende."
With empty hand men may lure no hawks;	With empty hand men may na haukes tulle;
And we will pay truly at the full.	And we wil payen trewely atte fulle.
But specially I pray thee, host dear,	But specially I pray thee, hooste deere,
Such as he finds, or take such as he brings.'	Slyk as he fyndes, or taa slyk as he brynges.'

"Now, Symond," said John, "by Saint Cuthbert,	"Now, Symond," seyde John, "by Seint Cutberd,
Or make it large by speech, as is your custom."	Or make it rowm with speche, as is youre gise."
Let's see now if this place may suffice,	Lat se now if this place may suffise,
A mile broad out of twenty feet of space.	A myle brood of twenty foot of space.
You know how by logical arguments to make a place	Ye konne by argumentes make a place
Such as it is, yet shall you have your share.	Swich as it is, yet shal ye have youre part.
The miller said in reply, "If there be any,	The millere seyde agayn, "If ther be eny,
For lodging and for refreshment, for their cash.	Of herberwe and of ese, as for hir peny.
But for the love of God they ask him	But for the love of God they hym bisoght
For it was night, and further they could not go;	For it was nyght, and forther myghte they noght;
The miller sitting by the fire he found,	The millere sittynge by the fyr he fond,
Toward the mill, and the horse Bayard in his hand.	Toward the mille, and Bayard in his hond.
Thus laments John as he goes by the way	Thus pleyneth John as he gooth by the way
And namely the miller, wellaway!"	And namely the millere, weylaway!"
Our grain is stolen; men will call us fools,	Oure corn is stoln; men wil us fooles calle,
Now are we driven to contempt and to scorn.	Now are we dryve til hethyng and til scorn.
"Alas," said John, "the day that I was born!	"Allas," quod John, "the day that I was born!
Comes hapless John, and with him comes Aleyn.	Comth sely John, and with him comth Aleyn.
Weary and wet, as a beast is in the rain,	Wery and weet, as beest is in the reyn,
Until in a ditch they caught him at the last.	Til in a dych they caughte hym atte laste.
Catch their horse, he ran always so fast,	Hir capul cacche, he ran alwey so faste,
They could not, though they did al their might,	They koude nat, though they dide al hir myght,
But shortly, until that it was truly night,	But shortly, til that it was verray nyght,
With "Stop! Stop! Stand! Stand! Down there, watch out behind,	With "Keep! Keep! Stand! Stand! Jossa, warderere,
These hapless clerks run up and down	Thise sely clerkes rennen up and doun
They will not catch him easily, by my crown."	They gete hym nat so lightly, by my croun."
Lo, there he goes! Yes, let the children play.	Lo, wher he gooth! Ye, lat the children pleye.
Despite all his learning; now let them go their way!	For al his art; now lat hem goon hir weye!
Yet can a miller make a clerk's beard (trick a clerk),	Yet kan a millere make a clerkes berd,
He said, "I suppose the clerks were leery (of what I might do).	He seyde, "I trowe the clerkes were aferd.
And ordered his wife to go knead it in a cake.	And bad his wyf go knede it in a cake.
He half a bushel of their flour has taken,	He half a busshel of hir flour hath take,
Toward the fen, both Aleyn and also John.	Toward the fen, bothe Aleyn and eek John.
These hapless clerks have run very fast	Thise sely clerkes han ful faste yronne
Bad luck! By God, Alayn, thou art a fool!"	Ilhayl! By God, Alayn, thou is a fonne!"
Why did thou not put the horse in the barn?	Why ne had thow pit the capul in the lathe?
By God's heart, he shall not escape us both!	By Goddes herte, he sal nat scape us bathe!
I am full strong (swift), God knows, as is a roe deer;	I is ful wight, God waat, as is a raa;
Lay down thy sword, and I will mine also.	Lay doun thy swerd, and I wil myn alswa.
"Alas," said John, "Aleyn, for Christ's pain	"Allas," quod John, "Aleyn, for Cristes peyne
And he that should have tied the rein better!"	And he that bettre sholde han knyt the reyne!"
With wild mares, as fast as he can go.	With wilde mares, as faste as he may go.
She said, "Alas! your horse goes to the fen	She seyde, "Allas! youre hors goth to the fen
The wife cam leaping inward at a run.	The wyf cam lepynge inward with a ren.
"What, which way is he gone?" he began to cry.	"What, whilk way is he geen?" he gan to crie.
All his skillful management was out of his mind.	Al was out of his mynde his housbondrie.
This Aleyn forgot everything, both meal and grain;	This Aleyn al forgat, bothe mele and corn;
Alas, our warden has lost his saddle horse."	Allas, our wardeyn has his palfrey lorn."
Step on thy feet! Come on, man, quickly!	Step on thy feet! Com of, man, al atanes!
Our horse is lost, Alayn, for God's bones,	Oure hors is lorn, Alayn, for Goddes banes,
This John goes out and finds his horse gone away,	This John goth out and fynt his hors away,
And when the meal is sacked and tied,	And whan the mele is sakked and ybounde,
Until their grain was completely ground.	Til that hir corn was faire and weel ygrounde.
But does his work, and with the clerks amused himself	But dooth his note, and with the clerkes pleyde
This miller goes back to the mill, no word he said,	This millere gooth agayn, no word he seyde,
And forth with "wehee," through thick and through thin.	And forth with "wehee," thurgh thikke and thurgh thenne.
Toward the fen, where wild mares run,	Toward the fen, ther wilde mares renne,
And when the horse was loose, he begins to go	And whan the hors was laus, he gynneth gon
He strips off the bridle right away.	He strepeth of the brydel right anon.
Behind the mill, under an arbor;	Bihynde the mille, under a levesel;
The clerks' horse, where it stood tied	The clerkes hors, ther as it stood ybounde
He looks up and down until he has found	He looketh up and doun til he hath founde
When he saw his time, quietly.	Whan that he saugh his tyme, softely.
Out at the door he goes full stealthily,	Out at the dore he gooth ful pryvely,
All their learning I reckon not worth a weed."	Of al hir art counte I noght a tare."
As once to the wolf thus spoke the mare.	As whilom to the wolf thus spak the mare.
`The greatest clerks are not the wisest men,'	`The gretteste clerkes been noght wisest men,'
Instead of flour yet will I give them bran.	In stide of flour yet wol I yeve hem bren.
The more ingenious tricks that they make,	The moore queynte crekes that they make,
Despite all the trickery in their philosophy.	For al the sleighte in hir philosophye.
But by my welfare, yet shall I blear their eyes (fool them),	But by my thrift, yet shal I blere hir ye,
They think that no man can trick them,	They wene that no man may hem bigyle,
And thought, "All this is done only for a trick.	And thoghte, "Al this nys doon but for a wyle.
This miller smiled at their foolishness,	This millere smyled of hir nycetee,
I am as poor a miller as you are."	I is as ille a millere as ar ye."
For John, in faith, I may be like you;	For John, y-faith, I may been of youre sort;
Into the trough; that shall be my sport.	Into the trough; that sal be my disport.
Then will I be beneath, by my head,	Thanne wil I be bynethe, by my croun,
Aleyn answered, "John, and wilt thou do so?	Aleyn answerde, "John, and wiltow swa?
How the hopper wags to and fro."	How that the hopur wagges til and fra."
Yet saw I never, by my father's kin,	Yet saugh I nevere, by my fader kyn,
Said John, "and see how the grain goes in.	Quod John, "and se howgates the corn gas in.
"By God, right by the hopper will I stand,"	"By God, right by the hopur wil I stande,"
What will you do while it is being done?"	What wol ye doon whil that it is in hande?"
"It shall be done," said Symkyn, "by my faith!	"It shal be doon," quod Symkyn, "by my fay!

And therefore I am come, and also Alayn,	And forthy is I come, and eek Alayn,
So continually ache the teeth in his head;	Swa werkes ay the wanges in his heed;
Our manciple, I expect he will be dead,	Oure manciple, I hope he wil be deed,
Or else he is a fool, as clerks say.	Or elles he is a fool, as clerkes sayn.
He who has no servant must serve himself,	Hym boes serve hymself that has na swayn,
"Symond," said John, "by God, need knows no law.	"Symond," quod John, "by God, nede has na peer.
And John also, how now, what do you here?"	And John also, how now, what do ye heer?"
"Aleyn, welcome," said Symkyn, "by my life!	"Aleyn, welcome," quod Symkyn, "by my lyf!
How fares thy faire daughter and thy wife?"	Hou fares thy faire doghter and thy wyf?"
And at the mill he lays the sack down.	And at the mille the sak adoun he layth.
John knew the way -- they needed no guide --	John knew the wey -- hem nedede no gyde --
With good sword and with buckler by their sides.	With good swerd and with bokeler by hir syde.
Forth goes Aleyn the clerk, and also John,	Forth goth Aleyn the clerk, and also John,
And on a horse the sack he cast immediately.	And on an hors the sak he caste anon.
This Aleyn makes ready all his gear,	This Aleyn maketh redy al his gere,
Far in the north; I can not tell where.	Fer in the north; I kan nat telle where.
Of one town were they born, that was called Strother,	Of o toun were they born, that highte Strother,
John was called that one, and Aleyn was called that other;	John highte that oon, and Aleyn highte that oother;
Of grain by trickery, nor rob them by force;	Of corn by sleighte, ne by force hem reve;
The miller should not steal from them half a peck	The millere sholde not stele hem half a pekke
And boldly they dared pledge their necks	And hardily they dorste leye hir nekke
To go to the mill and see their grain ground;	To goon to mille and seen hir corn ygrounde;
To give them leave, for but a little while,	To yeve hem leve, but a litel stounde,
Upon the warden busily they implore	Upon the wardeyn bisily they crye
And, only for their mirth and amusement,	And, oonly for hire myrthe and revelrye,
Headstrong they were, and eager for sport,	Testif they were, and lusty for to pleye,
Who dwelt in this hall, of which I tell.	That dwelten in this halle, of which I seye.
He blustered fiercely, and swore it was not so.	He craketh boost, and swoor it was nat so.
But the miller thought that not worth a weed;	But therof sette the millere nat a tare;
For which the warden (of the college) complained and made a fuss.	For which the wardeyn chidde and made fare.
But now he was a thief excessively,	But now he was a theef outrageously,
For before this he stole but courteously,	For therbiforn he stal but curteisly,
A hundred times more than before;	An hundred tyme moore than biforn;
For which this miller stole both meal and grain	For which this millere stal bothe mele and corn
People thought indeed that he should die.	Men wenden wisly that he sholde dye.
The manciple lay sick with a malady;	Sik lay the maunciple on a maladye;
There their wheat and also their malt was ground.	Ther was hir whete and eek hir malt ygrounde.
People call the Soler Hall at Cambridge;	Men clepen the Soler Halle at Cantebregge;
And namely there was an important college	And nameliche ther was a greet collegge
With wheat and malt of all the land about;	With whete and malt of al the land aboute;
A profitable monopoly on milling has this miller, out of doubt,	Greet sokene hath this millere, out of doute,
Though he holy church should devour.	Though that he hooly chirche sholde devoure.
Therefore he would his holy blood honor,	Therfore he wolde his hooly blood honoure,
To holy church's blood, which is descended from the church.	On hooly chirches blood, that is descended.
For holy church's goods must be dispensed	For hooly chirches good moot been despended
His purpose was to bestow her high	His purpos was for to bistowe hire hye
And he raised difficulties about her marriage.	And straunge he made it of hir mariage.
Both of his property and his household,	Bothe of his catel and his mesuage,
Was determined to make her his heir,	In purpos was to maken hire his heir,
This parson of the town, because she was fair,	This person of the toun, for she was feir,
But right fair was her hair; I will not lie.	But right fair was hire heer; I wol nat lye.
With buttocks broad and breasts round and high.	With buttokes brode and brestes rounde and hye.
With pug nose and eyes gray as glass,	With kamus nose and eyen greye as glas,
This wench was thick and well grown,	This wenche thikke and wel ygrowen was,
Except for a child that was a half year of age;	Savynge a child that was of half yeer age;
Of twenty years of age, without any more,	Of twenty yeer, withouten any mo,
A daughter had they between them two	A doghter hadde they bitwixe hem two
Which she had learned in the nunnery.	That she hadde lerned in the nonnerie.
Considering her family and her education	What for hire kynrede and hir nortelrie
She thought that a lady should be aloof,	Hir thoughte that a lady sholde hire spare,
And full of disdain and of scorn.	And ful of hoker and of bisemare.
She was as haughty as water in a ditch,	She was as digne as water in a dich,
And also, because she was a bit besmirched (by her illegitimacy),	And eek, for she was somdel smoterlich,
For jealous folk are dangerous always --	For jalous folk ben perilous everemo --
With cutlass, or with knife, or dagger.	With panade, or with knyf, or boidekyn.
Unless he wished to be slain by Symkyn	But if he wolde be slayn of Symkyn
That dared flirt with her or once play,	That with hire dorste rage or ones pleye,
There was no one so brave that went by the way	Was noon so hardy that wente by the weye
There dared no one call her anything but "lady";	Ther dorste no wight clepen hire but "dame";
And Symkyn had hose of the same color.	And Symkyn hadde hosen of the same.
And she came after in a gown of red;	And she cam after in a gyte of reed;
With the tip of his hood wound about his head,	With his typet wounde aboute his heed,
A very fair sight was it to look upon those two;	A ful fair sighte was it upon hem two;
And she was proud, and brazen as is a magpie.	And she was proud, and peert as is a pye.
To preserve his state of yeomanry.	To saven his estaat of yomanrye.
Unless she were well educated and a virgin,	But she were wel ynorissed and a mayde,
For Symkyn would have no wife, as he said,	For Symkyn wolde no wyf, as he sayde,

To sleep five hours upon a night,	Fyve houres for to slepe upon a nyght,
"Niece," said he, "it ought enough suffice	"Nece," quod he, "it oghte ynough suffise
"What ails you to rise so early?"	"What eyleth yow so rathe for to ryse?"
For the maid was yet subject to adult discipline.	For yet under the yerde was the mayde.
Whom she may govern and guide as she pleases,	Which as hir list she may governe and gye,
A maid servant came in her company,	A mayde child cam in hire compaignye,
And salutes him, as she has often done.	And hym saleweth, as she hath doon ofte.
Into the garden, where he walks quietly,	Into the gardyn, there he walketh softe,
This good wife came walking alone	This goode wyf cam walkynge pryvely
And has said his prayers very courteously.	And hath his thynges seyd ful curteisly.
And in the garden walks to and fro,	And in the gardyn walketh to and fro,
Don John had also risen in the morning,	Daun John was rysen in the morwe also,
From (making) his accounts, for the time being;	Of his acountes, for the meene tyme;
And also he wanted that no one should hinder him	And eek he nolde that no man sholde hym lette
For which he very tightly shut his counting house-door;	For which ful faste his countour-dore he shette;
His treasure and his hoard was very rich,	Ful riche was his tresor and his hord,
He lays before him on his counting-board.	He leith biforn hym on his countyng-bord.
His account books and his moneybags many a one	His bookes and his bagges many oon
And if he had profited or not.	And if that he encressed were or noon.
And how he had spent his funds,	And how that he despended hadde his good,
Of that same year how it stood with him,	Of thilke yeer how that it with hym stood,
And he goes up into his counting-house	And up into his countour-hous gooth he
And seriously considers his business,	And on his nedes sadly hym avyseth,
The third day, this merchant up arises,	The thridde day, this marchant up ariseth,
This merchant and this monk, for a day or two.	This marchant and this monk, a day or tweye.
And thus I let them eat and drink and amuse themselves,	And thus I lete hem ete and drynke and pleye,
And game fowls, as always was his custom.	And volatyl, as ay was his usage.
And also another full of fine white wine,	And eek another ful of fyn vernage,
With him he brought a jug of malmsey wine,	With hym broghte he a jubbe of malvesye,
Our dear cousin, full of courtesy?	Oure deere cosyn, ful of curteisye?
And he comes quickly to Seint-Denis.	And unto Seint-Denys he comth anon.
To see to their granges and their capacious barns,	To seen hir graunges and hire bernes wyde,
And also an officer, to ride out	And eek an officer, out for to ryde,
Because he was a man of great prudence	By cause he was a man of heigh prudence
Has of his abbot, as he pleases, permission,	Hath of his abbot, as hym list, licence,
This noble monk, of whom I tell you,	This noble monk, of which I yow devyse,
Before he went to Bruges, indeed.	Er he to Brugges wente, in alle wise.
With him and with his wife a day or two,	With hym and with his wyf a day or tweye,
That he should come to Seint-Denis to visit	That he sholde come to Seint-Denys to pleye
For which he has to Paris sent immediately	For which he hath to Parys sent anon
To buy there a quantity of merchandise;	To byen there a porcioun of ware;
To travel to the town of Bruges ,	Toward the toun of Brugges for to fare,
Decided to make ready his preparations	Shoop hym to make redy his array
But as it happened, this merchant on a day	But so bifel, this marchant on a day
No more of this for now, for it suffices.	Na moore of this as now, for it suffiseth.
As a fowl is happy when the sun rises up.	As fowel is fayn whan that the sonne up riseth.
For which they were as glad of his coming	For which they were as glad of his comyng
When he came, some sort of suitable gift,	Whan that he cam, som manere honest thyng,
In all that house; but according to their rank,	In al that hous; but after hir degree,
He did not forget to give to the lowest ranking servant	He noght forgat to yeve the leeste page
To do pleasure, and also great expenditure.	To doon plesaunce, and also greet costage.
In that house, and full of diligence	As in that hous, and ful of diligence
Free-handed was Don John, and generous in spending	Free was daun John, and manly of dispence,
Of brotherhood while their life may endure.	Of bretherhede whil that hir lyf may dure.
And each of them assured the other	And ech of hem gan oother for t' assure
Thus are they knit with eternal alliance,	Thus been they knyt with eterne alliaunce,
For to his heart it was a great pleasure.	For to his herte it was a greet plesaunce.
And he does the same; he not once says 'nay,'	And he agayn; he seith nat ones nay,
The monk claims him as a kinsman,	The monk hym claymeth as for cosynage,
The two of them, were both born in one village,	Were bothe two yborn in o village,
And also this monk of whom I began (to tell),	And eek this monk of which that I bigan,
And in view of the fact that this good man,	And for as muchel as this goode man,
As it is possible for any friend to be.	As it is possible any freend to be.
That in his house as intimate was he	That in his hous as famulier was he
Since their first acquaintance began,	Sith that hir firste knoweliche bigan,
Was so acquainted with the good man,	Aqueynted was so with the goode man,
Who continually was drawing to that place.	That evere in oon was drawynge to that place.
I believe he was about thirty years old --	I trowe a thritty wynter he was oold --
There was a monk, a handsome man and a bold one --	Ther was a monk, a fair man and a boold --
Among all his guests, high ranking and low,	Amonges alle his gestes, grete and smale,
That it is a wonder; but listen to my tale.	That wonder is; but herkneth to my tale.
Because of his generosity, and because his wife was fair,	For his largesse, and for his wyf was fair,
For which he always had so many guests	For which he hadde alday so greet repair
This noble merchant held a worthy house,	This noble marchaunt heeld a worthy hous,
Or lend us gold, and that is perilous.	Or lene us gold, and that is perilous.
But thinks it is wasted and lost,	But thynketh it is wasted and ylost,
Or else desires to endure no such expense,	Or ellis list no swich dispence endure,
And if it happens he can not pay,	And if that he noght may, par aventure,
In which finery we dance merrily.	In which array we daunce jolily.
Richly, all for the sake of his own reputation,	Al for his owene worshipe richely,
He must clothe us, and he must adorn us	He moot us clothe, and he moot us arraye,
The poor (hapless) husband, always he must pay,	The sely housbonde, algate he moot paye,
But woe to him that must pay for all!	But wo is hym that payen moot for al!
Pass away as does a shadow upon the wall;	Passen as dooth a shadwe upon the wal;
That men do to them at festivities and at dances.	That men hem doon at festes and at daunces.
Than is worth all the good cheer and reverence	Than worth is al the chiere and reverence
Which is a thing that causes more expense	Which is a thyng that causeth more dispence
And she was sociable and fond of revelry,	And compaignable and revelous was she,
He had a wife of excellent beauty;	A wyf he hadde of excellent beautee;
Who was rich, for which men considered him wise.	That riche was, for which men helde hym wys.
A merchant once dwelled at Seint-Denis,	A marchant whilom dwelled at Seint-Denys,
Here begins the Shipman's Tale.	Heere bigynneth the Shipmannes Tale.
Then I will know well that it is good enough."	Thanne woot I wel that it is good ynow."
So far as my mental abilities will suffice.	As fer as that my wittes wol suffyse.
I will not offend you in any way	I wol yow nat contrarien in no wyse
Unto your will; now hearken what I say.	Unto your wyl; now herkneth what I seye.
"Gladly, sir Host," said he, "I will obey	"Gladly, sire Hoost," quod he, "I wole obeye
"Tell on thy tale without more words."	"Telle on thy tale withouten wordes mo."
Though to this man I speak a word or two."	Though to this man I speke a word or two."
"I pray you, hold me not in disdain,	"I prey yow, haveth me nat in desdeyn,
"That know I well, sir," said the Franklin.	"That knowe I wel, sire," quod the Frankeleyn.

"Straw for your nobility!" said our Host.	"Straw for youre gentillesse!" quod oure Hoost.
From whom he might learn true nobility."	Where he myghte lerne gentillesse aright."
Than converse with any noble person	Than to comune with any gentil wight
And he would rather talk with a serving boy	And he hath levere talken with a page
And lose all that he has is his usage.	And lese al that he hath is his usage.
But to play at dice, and to spend	But for to pleye at dees, and to despende
Because he has no desire to devote himself to virtue;	For he to vertu listeth nat entende;
I have rebuked my son, and shall again,	I have my sone snybbed, and yet shal,
As you are! Fie on possessions,	As that ye been! Fy on possessioun,
That he were a man of such discretion	He were a man of swich discrecioun
Though it right now were fallen in my hand,	Though it right now were fallen in myn hond,
I had rather than have twenty pound's worth of land,	I hadde levere than twenty pound worth lond,

For I take great pleasure in thy speech.	For of thy speche I have greet deyntee.
And in virtue send thee perseverance,	And in vertu sende thee continuaunce,
If thou live; God give thee good luck,	If that thou lyve; God yeve thee good chaunce,
That shall be thy equal in eloquence,	Of eloquence that shal be thy peere,
With such feeling thou speakest, sir, I praise thee!	So feelyngly thou spekest, sire, I allow the!
Said the Franklin, "considering thy youth,	Quod the Frankeleyn, "considerynge thy yowthe,

For Canacee ere he could win her.	For Canacee er that he myghte hire wynne.

Had he not been helped by the steed of brass;	Ne hadde he ben holpen by the steede of bras;
For whom full often in great peril he was,	For whom ful ofte in greet peril he was,
How he won Theodora to his wife,	How that he wan Theodora to his wif,
And after I will speak of Algarsif,	And after wol I speke of Algarsif,
That in his time many a city won;	That in his tyme many a citee wan;
First will I tell you of Cambyuskan,	First wol I telle yow of Cambyuskan,
That never yet were heard such great marvels.	That nevere yet was herd so grete mervailles.
To speak of adventures and of battles	To speken of aventures and of batailles
But henceforth I will keep to my narrative	But hennesforth I wol my proces holde
By the mediation of Cambalus,	By mediacion of Cambalus,
Repentant, as the story tells us,	Repentant, as the storie telleth us,
How this falcon got back her love,	How that this faucon gat hire love ageyn
Until it becomes again appropriate to tell	Til it come eft to purpos for to seyn
I will for now speak no more of her ring	I wol namoore as now speke of hir ryng
Thus I leave Canacee keeping her hawk;	Thus lete I Canacee hir hauk kepyng;
Magpies, to cry out against them and chide them.	Pyes, on hem for to crie and chyde.
For sheer scorn were painted beside them,	Right for despit were peynted hem bisyde,
Such as are these small birds, falcons, and owls;	As ben thise tidyves, tercelettes, and owles;
And on all the outside, the pen is painted green,	And al withoute, the mewe is peynted grene,
As a sign of truth that is in women seen.	In signe of trouthe that is in wommen sene.
And covered it with velvet cloths, blue	And covered it with veluettes blewe,
And by her bed's head she made a pen	And by hire beddes heed she made a mewe
She devotes her efforts and all her power,	She dooth hire bisynesse and al hire myght,
With which to heal this hawk. From dawn to nighttime	To heelen with this hauk. Fro day to nyght
Of herbs, precious and delicate in color,	Of herbes preciouse and fyne of hewe
Out of the ground, and make new salves	Out of the ground, and make salves newe
Now Canacee can do nothing but dig herbs	Now kan nat Canacee but herbes delve
And softly did wrap her in bandages,	And softely in plastres gan hire wrappe,
But Canacee carries her home enfolded in her gown,	But Canacee hom bereth hire in hir lappe,
They knew not how they might cheer up the falcon.	They nyste hou they myghte the faucon glade.
That Canacee and all her women made;	That Canacee and alle hir wommen made;
Great was the sorrow for the hawk's harm	Greet was the sorwe for the haukes harm
And swooned again in Canacee's lap.	And swowned eft in Canacees barm.
And with that word this falcon did cry out	And with that word this faucon gan to crie
And I am lost, without remedy!"	And I am lorn withouten remedie!"
Thus has the kite my lover in her service,	Thus hath the kyte my love in hire servyse,
That all his love is completely gone from me,	That al his love is clene fro me ago,
And suddenly he so loved this kite	And sodeynly he loved this kyte so
He saw upon a time a kite (scavenger bird) fly by,	He saugh upon a tyme a kyte flee,
And goodly to look upon and humble and generous,	And goodlich for to seen, and humble and free,
Though he was of noble birth, and fresh and gay,	Though he were gentil born, and fressh and gay,
"So fared this falcon, alas the day!	"So ferde this tercelet, allas the day!
No nobility of blood can restrain them.	No gentillesse of blood ne may hem bynde.
And love novelties because of their nature,	And loven novelries of propre kynde,
They are so fond of novelty in their food,	So newefangel been they of hire mete,
He with his feet will kick down his cup,	He with his feet wol spurne adoun his cuppe,
Yet just as soon as his door is left open	Yet right anon as that his dore is uppe
And give them sugar, honey, bread and milk,	And yeve hem sugre, hony, breed and milk,
And strew their cages with straw fair and soft as silk,	And strawe hir cage faire and softe as silk,
For though thou take care of them night and day,	For though thou nyght and day take of hem hede,
As do birds that men feed in cages.	As briddes doon that men in cages fede.
Men, because of their nature, love novelty,	Men loven of propre kynde newefangelnesse,
Makes himself happy;' thus say men, as I suppose.	Gladeth hymself;' thus seyn men, as I gesse.
That `every thing, by returning to its natural state,	That `alle thyng, repeirynge to his kynde,
When he decided to rest,	Whan it cam hym to purpos for to reste,
And forth he speeds until he came where he pleased.	And forth he fleeth til he cam ther hym leste.
So at the last he had to go forth on his way,	So atte laste he moste forth his weye,
Who shall eat with a fiend,' thus I have heard said.	That shal ete with a feend,' thus herde I seye.
`Therefore she must have a very long spoon	`Therfore bihoveth hire a ful long spoon
When he has said everything well, then he has done (all he will do).	Whan he hath al wel seyd, thanne hath he doon.
Who can speak better than he, who can act worse?	Who kan sey bet than he, who kan do werse?
What he answered, it needs not be repeated;	What he answerde, it nedeth noght reherce;
Be to me such as I to you have been and shall be.'	Beth swich as I to yow have been and shal.'
And took him by the hand, with Saint John as my guarantor,	And took hym by the hond, Seint John to borwe,
As I best could, I hid from him my sorrow,	As I best myghte, I hidde fro hym my sorwe,
And took it well, since it had to be.	And took it wel, syn that it moste be.
So that I made virtue of necessity,	That I made vertu of necessitee,
For his honor, as often it happens so,	For his honour, as ofte it happeth so,
And it was reasonable also that he must go	And resoun wolde eek that he moste go
Within a little while, to say the truth;	Withinne a litel while, sooth to seyn;
And also that he should return again	And eek that he repaire sholde ageyn
But nevertheless, I thought he was so true,	But nathelees, I thoughte he was so trewe,
That he had felt as much harm as I,	That he had felt as muche harm as I,
So sorrowfully also that I believed truly	So sorwefully eek that I wende verraily
So one day he took his leave of me,	So on a day of me he took his leve,
Such harm I felt because he could not remain.	Swich harm I felte for he ne myghte bileve.
By this experience I know what is the pain of death;	I knowe what is the peyne of deeth therby;
For one thing I dare tell boldly:	For o thyng dar I tellen boldely:
I can not make a description of it.	I kan nat make of it discripsioun.
Whether I was woeful, there is no question;	Wher me was wo, that is no questioun;
Out of that place where I was.	Out of that place which that I was inne.
But finally, thus at the last it stood,	But finally, thus atte laste it stood,
That I supposed of him nothing but good.	That I supposed of hym noght but good.
"This lasted longer than a year or two,	"This laste lenger than a yeer or two,
As him, God knows, nor never shall again.	As hym, God woot, ne nevere shal namo.
Nor never loved anyone more, or even as much	Ne nevere hadde I thyng so lief, ne levere,
Keeping ever the limits set by my honor.	Kepynge the boundes of my worshipe evere.
In all things, so far as was consonant with reason,	In alle thyng, as fer as reson fil,
This is to say, my will obeyed his will	This is to seyn, my wyl obeyed his wyl
That my will was his will's instrument;	That my wyl was his willes instrument;
It seemed to me I felt death twist my heart.	Me thoughte I felte deeth myn herte twiste.
Although it were never so little, and I knew of it,	Al were it never so lite, and I it wiste,
That if it so were that any thing pained him,	That if so were that any thyng hym smerte,
And for the truth I believed was in his heart,	And for the trouthe I demed in his herte,
And I so loved him for his obeisance,	And I so loved hym for his obeisaunce,
Both his words and his countenance.	As wel his wordes as his contenaunce.
So painted he and made himself elegant in every way,	So peynted he and kembde at point-devys
For any woman, were she never so wise,	Til any womman, were she never so wys,
His manner was a heaven to see	His manere was an hevene for to see
Where duplicity or feigning were concerned,	Ther doublenesse or feynyng sholde approche,
Nor were worthy to unbuckle his galosh,	Ne were worthy unbokelen his galoche,
Reproduce the deceptive sophisms of his art,	Countrefete the sophymes of his art,
Could (any) man, by (so much as) one twenty thousandth,	Ne koude man, by twenty thousand part,
Nor ever, since the first man was born,	Ne nevere, syn the firste man was born,
To love two, as folk wrote long ago --	To loven two, as writen folk biforn --
Since Lameth was, he who first of all began	Syn Lameth was, that alderfirst bigan
Jason? certainly, nor any other man	Jason? certes, ne noon oother man
That never Jason nor Paris of Troy --	That nevere Jason ne Parys of Troye --
So like a gentle lover in his manners,	So lyk a gentil lovere of manere,
With such high reverence, and, as seemed by his appearance,	With so heigh reverence, and, as by his cheere,
Fell on his knees with such devout humility,	Fil on his knees with so devout humblesse,
Immediately this tiger, full of treachery,	Anon this tigre, ful of doublenesse,
As he swore he gave his heart to me,	As he swoor he yaf his herte to me,
And gave him my true heart as freely	And yeven hym my trewe herte as free
In such a manner as I have said above,	In swich a gyse as I have seyd above,
That I had granted him fully my love	That I hadde graunted hym fully my love
And when he saw the business so far advanced	And whan he saugh the thyng so fer ygoon
But truly it is said, since many a day gone by,	But sooth is seyd, goon sithen many a day,
And took his heart in exchange for mine for ever.	And took his herte in chaunge of myn for ay.
God knows and he, I would not have agreed on any other terms --	God woot and he, that ootherwise noght --
I gave him all my heart and all my thought --	I yaf hym al myn herte and al my thoght --
This is to say, that according to his deserts,	This is to seyn, that after his desert,
Were safe, both in private and in public (in all ways);	Were saved, bothe privee and apert;
That evermore my honor and renown	That everemoore myn honour and renoun
Granted him love, upon this condition,	Graunted hym love, upon this condicioun,
Upon receiving his oaths and his pledges,	Upon his othes and his seuretee,
Entirely ignorant of his consummate malice,	Al innocent of his crouned malice,
Until my heart, too compassionate and too naive,	Til that myn herte, to pitous and to nyce,
And many a year his service to me feigned,	And many a yeer his service to me feyned,
Until he so long had wept and complained,	Til he so longe hadde wopen and compleyned,
So that, except for the fiend, no one knew what he meant,	That, save the feend, noon wiste what he mente,
And in this manner he served his own purpose	And in this wise he served his entente
Such was this hypocrite, in every circumstance.	Swich was this ypocrite, bothe coold and hoot.
And under is the corpse, as you know,	And under is the corps, swich as ye woot,
As in a tomb all the beauty is above,	As in a toumbe is al the faire above,
And keeps in outward appearance all his observances	And kepeth in semblaunt alle his observaunces
So does his ceremonies and obeisances,	Dooth so his cerymonyes and obeisaunces,
Just so this god of love's hypocrite	Right so this god of loves ypocryte
Until he can see his time to bite,	Til he may seen his tyme for to byte,
Just as a serpent hides himself under flowers	Right as a serpent hit hym under floures
So deeply in a fast dye he dyed his true colors.	So depe in greyn he dyed his coloures.
That no creature could have supposed he could feign,	That no wight koude han wend he koude feyne,
Under pleasantness, and under careful attentiveness,	Under plesance, and under bisy peyne,
And under the appearance of truth in such a manner,	And under hewe of trouthe in swich manere,
Although he was full of treason and falseness,	Al were he ful of treson and falsnesse,
That seemed an exemplar of all nobility;	That semed welle of alle gentillesse;
Then dwelt a male falcon very near me,	Tho dwelte a tercelet me faste by,
Until I could fly full high under the sky.	Til I koude flee ful hye under the sky.
I knew not what was adversity	I nyste nat what was adversitee
So tenderly that no thing ailed me,	So tendrely that no thyng eyled me,
And fostered on a cliff of marble gray	And fostred in a roche of marbul gray
"Where I was bred -- alas, that same day! --	"Ther I was bred -- allas, that ilke day! --
And, with a sigh, right thus she spoke her mind:	And, with a syk, right thus she seyde hir wille:
That other wept as she would turn to water	That oother weep as she to water wolde
And ever, while that one her sorrow told,	And evere, whil that oon hir sorwe tolde,
My harm I will reveal ere I go away."	Myn harm I wol confessen er I pace."
While that I have the time and the opportunity,	Whil that I have a leyser and a space,
Right for that cause and to that conclusion,	Right for that cause and that conclusion,
As by the whelp chastised is the lion,	As by the whelp chasted is the leon,
And to make others be warned by my example,	And for to maken othere be war by me,
But to obey unto your heart noble,	But for to obeye unto youre herte free,
But for no hope to fare the better,	But for noon hope for to fare the bet,
Out of true womanly goodness	Of verray wommanly benignytee
Compassion, my faire Canacee,	Compassion, my faire Canacee,
I see well that you have of my distress	I se wel that ye han of my distresse
For a gentle heart makes known its noble character.	For gentil herte kitheth gentillesse.
As well by deeds as by written authority;	As wel by werk as by auctoritee;
Is proven every day, as men may it see,	Is preved alday, as men may it see,
Feeling its counterpart in sharp pains,	Feelynge his similitude in peynes smerte,
"That pity runs soon in a gentle heart,	"That pitee renneth soone in gentil herte,
Right in her hawk's language thus she said:	Right in hir haukes ledene thus she seyde:
Until the time she awoke from the swoon.	Unto the tyme she gan of swough awake.
Until Canacee has in her lap her taken	Til Canacee hath in hire lappe hire take
And lies in a swoon, dead and like a stone,	And lith aswowne, deed and lyk a stoon,
Than ever she did, and fell to ground straightway,	Than ever she dide, and fil to grounde anon,
Then shrieked this falcon yet more pitifully	Tho shrighte this faucon yet moore pitously
With which to heal your hurts quickly."	To heel with youre hurtes hastily."
And herbs shall I in abundance find	And herbes shal I right ynowe yfynde
So help me great God of nature!	As wisly helpe me grete God of kynde!
I would amend it ere it were night,	I wolde amenden it er that it were nyght,
If that I truly knew the cause	If that I verraily the cause knewe
And as I am a king's daughter true,	And as I am a kynges doghter trewe,
For God's love, come down from the tree;	For Goddes love, com fro the tree adoun;
I have of you such great compassion.	I have of yow so greet compassioun.
You slay me with your sorrow truly,	Ye sle me with youre sorwe verraily,
That treated himself so piteously.	That ferde with hymself so pitously.
I saw never ere now no bird nor beast	Ne saugh I nevere er now no bryd ne beest
Or what can be your help? For west nor east	Or what may been youre help? For west nor est
For love of God, spare yourself,	For love of God, as dooth youreselven grace,
Must be the reason for your cruel deed,	Moot been enchesoun of youre cruel dede,
Which proves well that either anger or fear	Which proveth wel that outher ire or drede
For you avenge yourself upon yourself,	For ye youreself upon yourself yow wreke,
Of other harm there is no need to speak.	Of oother harm it nedeth nat to speke.
That most cause woe to a gentle heart;	That causen moost a gentil herte wo;
For, as I believe, these are the two causes	For, as I trowe, thise been causes two
"Is this for sorrow of death or loss of love?	"Is this for sorwe of deeth or los of love?
Said Canacee unto this hawk above.	Quod Canacee unto this hauk above.
That you be in this pain such as the Furies suffer in hell?"	That ye be in this furial pyne of helle?"
Unto the hawk, as you shall after hear:	Unto the hauk, as ye shal after heere:
Until at the last she spoke in this manner	Til atte laste she spak in this manere
A long while to await her she stood	A longe whil to wayten hire she stood
When it swooned next, for lack of blood.	Whan that it swowned next, for lak of blood.
The falcon must fall from the branch,	The faukon moste fallen fro the twiste,
And spread wide her skirt, for well she knew	And heeld hir lappe abrood, for wel she wiste
And on this falcon looks compassionately,	And on this faukon looketh pitously,
And to the tree she goes full hastily,	And to the tree she gooth ful hastily,
And well nigh for the pity she almost died.	And wel neigh for the routhe almoost she deyde.
And could answer him in his language in return,	And koude answeren hym in his ledene ageyn,
That any fowl may in his language say,	That any fowel may in his leden seyn,
Through which she well understood every thing	Thurgh which she understood wel every thyng
That on her finger bore the strange ring,	That on hir fynger baar the queynte ryng,
This fair king's daughter, Canacee,	This faire kynges doghter, Canacee,
Until well nigh is she fallen from the tree.	Til wel neigh is she fallen fro the tree.
She swoons every now and then for lack of blood,	She swowneth now and now for lak of blood,
From foreign land; and repeatedly, as she stood,	Of fremde land; and everemoore, as she stood,
A peregrine falcon then seemed she	A faucon peregryn thanne semed she
As well in plumage as in nobility	As wel of plumage as of gentillesse
That heard of its equal in beauty,	That herde of swich another of fairnesse,
If I could well describe a falcon,	If that I koude a faucon wel discryve,
For there was never yet no man alive,	For ther nas nevere yet no man on lyve,
For sorrow of her, she shrieked always so loud.	For sorwe of hire, she shrighte alwey so loude.
That would not have wept, if he could weep,	That nolde han wept, if that he wepe koude,
That dwells either in wood or in forest,	That dwelleth outher in wode or in forest,
That there is no tiger, nor any beast so cruel	That ther nys tygre, ne noon so crueel beest
And with her beak herself she so stabbed	And with hir beek hirselven so she prighte
Ran down the length of the tree in which she stood.	Ran endelong the tree ther-as she stood.
With both her wings until the red blood	With bothe hir wynges til the rede blood
She had beaten herself so pitifully	Ybeten hadde she hirself so pitously
That all the wood resounded with her cry.	That all the wode resouned of hire cry.
That with a pitiful voice so did cry	That with a pitous voys so gan to crye
There sat a falcon over her head full high,	Ther sat a faucon over hire heed ful hye,
As Canacee was amusing herself in her walk,	As Canacee was pleyyng in hir walk,
In a tree, for dryness as white as chalk,	Amydde a tree, for drye as whit as chalk,
And quickly put an end to her walking.	And maken of hir walkyng soone an ende.
And by the same reason, it seems to me,	And by the same resoun, thynketh me,
Because of the overabundance of its prolixity;	For fulsomnesse of his prolixitee;
The taste (for it) passes away more and more,	The savour passeth ever lenger the moore,
Of those who have listened to it for a long time,	Of hem that han it after herkned yoore,
If it is delayed until the desire (to hear it) is cold	If it be taried til that lust be coold
The main point for which every tale is told,	The knotte why that every tale is toold,
Exactly by their song, and knew all their meaning.	Right by hir song, and knew al hire entente.
For right away she knew what they meant	For right anon she wiste what they mente
And for the fowls that she heard sing.	And for the foweles that she herde synge.
That it made all their hearts to lighten,	That it made alle hire hertes for to lighte,
But nonetheless it was so fair a sight	But nathelees it was so fair a sighte
Made the sun seem ruddy and broad;	Made the sonne to seme rody and brood;
The vapor that glided up from the earth	The vapour which that fro the erthe glood
And in a path forth in the park goes she.	And in a trench forth in the park gooth she.
With no more than five or six of her entourage;	Nat but with fyve or sixe of hir meynee;
Lightly, to amuse herself and walk on foot,	Lightly, for to pleye and walke on foote,
Clothed, in accord with the lusty season sweet,	Arrayed after the lusty seson soote
And forth she walks at an easy pace,	And forth she walketh esily a pas,
That in the Ram is four degrees up run --	That in the Ram is foure degrees up ronne --
As ruddy and bright(ly shining) as does the young sun,	As rody and bright as dooth the yonge sonne,
Up rises fresh Canacee herself,	Up riseth fresshe Canacee hireselve,
And up they rise, a good ten or twelve;	And up they rysen, wel a ten or twelve;
Her governess calls a great crowd of women,	Hire maistresse clepeth wommen a greet route,
No longer to sleep -- and walk about."	Ne lenger for to slepe, and walke aboute."
"I want," said she, "to arise -- for I desire	"I wol," quod she, "arise, for me leste
Thus early, for the folk are all in bed?"	Thus erly, for the folk been alle on reste?"
And said, "Madame, whither do you wish to go	And seyde, "Madame, whider wil ye goon
These old women who are customarily wise,	Thise olde wommen that been gladly wyse,
And said that she wished to rise.	And seyde that hire liste for to ryse.
She called on her governess who was beside her,	She cleped on hir maistresse hire bisyde,
Therefore, before the sun did glide upward,	Wherfore, er that the sonne gan up glyde,
Made by her mirror, she had a vision.	Of hire mirour, she hadde a visioun.
And in her sleep, directly because of the mental impression	And in hire sleep, right for impressioun
That twenty times she changed her color;	That twenty tyme she changed hir colour;
Both of her strange ring and her mirror,	Bothe of hir queynte ryng and hire mirour,
For such a joy she in her heart took	For swich a joye she in hir herte took
Nor in the morning to appear unfestive,	Ne on the morwe unfeestlich for to se,
She did not wish to be grown pale,	Hir liste nat appalled for to be,
To go to rest soon after it was evening.	To goon to reste soone after it was eve.
For of her father had she taken leave	For of hir fader hadde she take leve
She was very temperate, as women are;	She was ful mesurable, as wommen be;
The most part, except for Canacee.	The mooste part, but it were Canacee.
They sleep until it was nine a.m.,	They slepen til that it was pryme large,
That causes dreams of which there is no significance.	That causeth dreem of which ther nys no charge.
Their heads were full of fumes from drinking wine,	Ful were hire heddes of fumositee,
As sleep them bad; they took it for the best.	As sleep hem bad; they tooke it for the beste.
And every creature did draw himself to his rest,	And every wight gan drawe hym to his reste,
They thank him yawning, by two, by three,	They thanken hym galpynge, by two, by thre,
"Cherish blood, nature's friend," said he.	"Cherisseth blood, natures freend," quod he.
For blood (the humor) was in its domination.	For blood was in his domynacioun.
And said that it was time to lie down,	And seyde that it was tyme to lye adoun,
And with a yawning mouth he kissed them all,	And with a galpyng mouth hem alle he keste,
That much drink and activity make rest necessary;	That muchel drynke and labour wolde han reste;
Did on them wink (as a signal) and bad them take notice	Gan on hem wynke and bad hem taken keep
Until well nigh the day began to spring.	Til wel ny the day bigan to sprynge.
This Cambyuskan entertaining his lords	This Cambyuskan his lordes festeiynge
But thus I leave in pleasure and jollity	But thus I lete in lust and jolitee
Out of their sight; you get no more from me.	Out of hir sighte; ye gete namoore of me.
The horse vanished, I know not in what manner,	The hors vanysshed, I noot in what manere,
And kept among his jewels precious and dear.	And kept among his jueles leeve and deere.
The bridle is carried unto the tower	The brydel is unto the tour yborn
Returns to his revel as before.	Repeireth to his revel as biforn.
Full glad and blithe, this noble doughty king	Ful glad and blithe, this noble doughty kyng
And has correctly understood	And hath conceyved in his wit aright
When the king was informed by that knight,	Enformed whan the kyng was of that knyght,
Ride when you wish; there is nothing more to do."	Ride whan yow list; ther is namoore to doone."
Between you and me, and that very soon.	Bitwixe yow and me, and that ful soone.
In such a manner as I shall to you say	In swich a gyse as I shal to yow seyn
When you wish to call him again	Whan that yow list to clepen hym ageyn
And come again, be it by day or night,	And come agayn, be it by day or nyght,
Out of the sight of every sort of creature,	Out of the sighte of every maner wight,
Turn this peg, and he will vanish at once	Trille this pyn, and he wol vanysshe anoon
He shall not thence be drawn nor carried away.	He shal nat thennes been ydrawe ne ybore.
Though all the world the contrary had sworn,	Though al the world the contrarie hadde yswore,
And in that place he will abide still.	And in that place he wol abyde stille.
And he will down descend and do your will,	And he wol doun descende and doon youre wille,
For therein lies the essence of working the device,	For therin lith th' effect of al the gyn,
Bid him descend, and turn another peg,	Bidde hym descende, and trille another pyn,
And when you come where you desire to abide,	And whan ye come ther as yow list abyde,
Or to what country, that you want to ride.	Or to what contree, that yow list to ryde.
You must name him to what place also,	Ye moote nempne hym to what place also,
You must turn a peg, which stands in his ear,	Ye mooten trille a pyn, stant in his ere,
But, when you desire to ride anywhere,	But, whan yow list to ryden anywhere,
And said, "Sir, there is no more to say,	And seyde, "Sire, ther is namoore to seyne,
When this knight laid hand upon his rein,	Whan that this knyght leyde hand upon his reyne,
This horse at once began to trip and dance,	This hors anoon bigan to trippe and daunce,
And prayed him to tell how to control him.	And preyde hym to telle his governaunce.
About the power of this courser and the might,	The vertu of this courser and the myght,
But finally the king asks this knight	But fynally the kyng axeth this knyght
Nor was there such a wondering as was then.	Ne was ther swich a wondryng as was tho.
That since the great siege of Troy was,	That syn the grete sege of Troie was,
Such wondering was there about this horse of brass	Swich wondryng was ther on this hors of bras
Of lords and of ladies about him.	Of lordes and of ladyes hym aboute.
To see this horse of brass, with all in a crowd	To seen this hors of bras, with al a route
At after-supper goes this noble king	At after-soper gooth this noble kyng
And dainties more than are in my knowing.	And deyntees mo than been in my knowyng.
Has plenty for the highest ranks and for the lowest,	Hath plentee to the meeste and to the leeste,
Each man knows well that a king's feast	Ech man woot wel that a kynges feeste
What need is there to tell you their splendor?	What nedeth yow rehercen hire array?
Unto the temple, as was reasonable, they wend.	Unto the temple, as reson was, they wende.
They eat and drink, and when this had an end,	They ete and drynke, and whan this hadde an ende,
The spiced cakes and the wine are come quickly.	The spices and the wyn is come anoon.
The ushers and the squires are gone,	The usshers and the squiers been ygoon,
And also the wine, amid all this music.	And eek the wyn, in al this melodye.
The steward ordered the spiced cakes to be brought quickly,	The styward bit the spices for to hye,
I leave them until people go to the supper.	I lete hem til men to the soper dresse.
I say no more, but in this jollity	I sey namoore, but in this jolynesse
Therefore I pass over all this pleasure;	Therfore I passe of al this lustiheed;
For dread of jealous men's perceptions?	For drede of jalouse mennes aperceyvynges?
Such subtle looking and dissimulations	Swich subtil lookyng and dissymulynges
So strange, and such cheerful countenances,	So unkouthe, and swiche fresshe contenaunces,
Who could tell you the form of dances	Who koude telle yow the forme of daunces
That should describe for you such splendor.	That sholde yow devysen swich array.
And be a convivial man as gay as May,	And been a feestlych man as fressh as May,
He must have known love and its service	He moste han knowen love and his servyse
That a dull-witted man is not able to describe.	That is nat able a dul man to devyse.

This foreign knight is fetched to him right away,	This strange knyght is fet to hym ful soone,
This noble king is set upon his throne.	This noble kyng is set upon his trone.
And looks on them with a friendly eye.	And looketh on hem with a freendly ye.
For in the Fish (Pisces) their lady sat full high,	For in the Fyssh hir lady sat ful hye,
Now dance lusty Venus's children dear,	Now dauncen lusty Venus children deere,

Where they sound diverse instruments	Ther as they sownen diverse instrumentz
Until he came to his chamber of tapestries (Presence Chamber),	Til he cam to his chambre of parementz,
Before him goes the loud music	Toforn hym gooth the loude mynstralcye

And yet ascending was the beast royal,	And yet ascendynge was the beest roial,
Phebus (the sun) has left the noon-time angle,	Phebus hath laft the angle meridional,
Until the king did from the table arise.	Til that the kyng gan fro the bord aryse.
Thus they chatter, and conjecture, and speculate	Thus jangle they, and demen, and devyse
And all things, until the cause is known.	And alle thyng, til that the cause is wyst.
About ebb tide, about flood tide, about spider webs, and about mist,	On ebbe, on flood, on gossomer, and on myst,
As intensely some wonder about the cause of thunder,	As soore wondren somme on cause of thonder,
But, because they have known it so long,	But, for they han yknowen it so fern,
And yet glass is not like ashes of fern;	And yet nys glas nat lyk asshen of fern;
Wondrous to make glass out of ashes of fern,	Wonder to maken of fern-asshen glas,
But nonetheless some said that it was	But nathelees somme seiden that it was
Thus say the people and draw themselves aside.	Thus seyn the peple and drawen hem apart.

Exactly in such a way as men may do with the sword	Right in swich wise as men may with the swerd
For he could with it both heal and harm,	For he koude with it bothe heele and dere,
And of Achilles with his magical spear,	And of Achilles with his queynte spere,
And fell in speech of Thelophus the king,	And fille in speche of Thelophus the kyng,
And other folk have wondered on the sword	And oother folk han wondred on the swerd
As know they who have heard their books (read aloud).	As knowen they that han hir bookes herd.
Of intricate mirrors and of optical lenses,	Of queynte mirours and of perspectives,

And said that in Rome was such a one.	And seyde that in Rome was swich oon.
Of angles and of ingenious reflections,	Of anglis and of slye reflexiouns,
Naturally, by arrangements	Naturelly, by composiciouns
Another answered and said it might well be	Another answerde and seyde it myghte wel be
That was carried up into the principal tower,	That born was up into the maister-tour,
And some of them wondered about the mirror,	And somme of hem wondred on the mirour,
They habitually suppose the worse.	They demen gladly to the badder ende.
Than they in their ignorance can comprehend;	Than they kan in hir lewednesse comprehende;
Of things that are made more subtly	Of thynges that been maad moore subtilly
As ignorant people speculate commonly	As lewed peple demeth comunly
Of various conjectures thus they chatter and debate,	Of sondry doutes thus they jangle and trete,
Such as conjurers play at these great feasts."	As jogelours pleyen at thise feestes grete."
An illusion made by some magic,	An apparence ymaad by som magyk,
Another whispered to his fellow quietly,	Another rowned to his felawe lowe,
It would be very good if all such things were known."	It were right good that al swich thyng were knowe."

Or else it was Sinon the Greek's horse,	Or elles it was the Grekes hors Synon,

For certainly, from his tail unto his ear	For certes, fro his tayl unto his ere
As if it were a noble Apulian courser.	As it a gentil Poilleys courser were.
In additon, with such equine virtues, and so quick of eye,	Therwith so horsly, and so quyk of ye,
Exactly as if it were a steed of Lombardy;	Right as it were a steede of Lumbardye;
So well proportioned to be strong,	So wel proporcioned for to been strong,
For it was so high, and so broad and long,	For it so heigh was, and so brood and long,
To stare on this horse that stands so,	To gauren on this hors that stondeth so,
Great was the crowd that swarms to and fro	Greet was the prees that swarmeth to and fro
To remove him, as you shall later hear.	To voyden hym, as ye shal after heere.
And therefore in the place they have it left	And therfore in the place they han it laft
And the reason why? Because they do not know the craft.	And cause why? For they kan nat the craft.
Despite any contrivance of windlass or pulley;	For noon engyn of wyndas or polyve;

And Saint Gregory says that `when a man considers well the number of his faults and of his sins,	And Seint Gregorie seith that `whan a man considereth wel the nombre of his defautes and of his synnes,

But yet it follows not thereof that every person to whom men do villainy should take vengeance for it,	But yet ne folweth it nat therof that every persone to whom men doon vileynye take of it vengeance,
For men say, `In much suffering shall many things happen to thee which thou shalt not be able to endure.'"	For men seyn, `In muchel suffrynge shul manye thynges falle unto thee whiche thou shalt nat mowe suffre.'"

For Seneca says, `Whatever man that is nourished by Fortune, she makes him a great fool.'	For Senec seith, `What man that is norissed by Fortune, she maketh hym a greet fool.'
I say that to that degree should you have the less trust in her and in her wisdom.	I seye that in so muchel shul ye the lasse truste in hire and in hir wit.
And whereas you say that Fortune has nourished you from your childhood,	And where as ye seyn that Fortune hath norissed yow fro youre childhede,

Trust not in her, for she is not steadfast nor stable,	Trusteth nat in hire, for she nys nat stidefast ne stable,

And, as the same Seneca says, `The more clear and the more shining that Fortune is,	And, as the same Senec seith, `The moore cleer and the moore shynyng that Fortune is,
for `things that are foolishly done, and that are in hope of Fortune, shall never come to a good end.'	for `thynges that been folily doon, and that been in hope of Fortune, shullen nevere come to good ende.'

For Seneca says thus: `That master,' he says, `is good who reproves scoundrels.'	For Senec seith thus: `That maister,' he seith, `is good that proveth shrewes.'
just so sins the judge if he do no vengeance on them that have deserved it.	right so synneth the juge if he do no vengeance of hem that it han disserved.
And yet say I more, that just as a private person sins in taking vengeance on another man,	And yet seye I moore, that right as a singuler persone synneth in takynge vengeance of another man,

and they that have will to do wickedness restrain their wicked purpose,	and they that han wyl to do wikkednesse restreyne hir wikked purpos,
