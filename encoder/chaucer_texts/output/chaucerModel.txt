A yong man called Melibeus, myghty and riche, bigat upon his wyf, that called was Prudence,	A young man called Melibeus, mighty and rich, begot upon his wife, who was called Prudence,
a doghter which that called was Sophie.	a daughter who was called Sophie.
Upon a day bifel that he for his desport is went into the feeldes hym to pleye.	Upon one day it happened that he for his pleasure went into the fields to amuse himself.
His wyf and eek his doghter hath he left inwith his hous, of which the dores weren faste yshette.	His wife and also his daughter has he left within his house of which the doors were tightly shut.
Thre of his olde foes han it espyed, and setten laddres to the walles of his hous,	Three of his old foes have seen this, and set ladders to the walls of his house,
and by wyndowes been entred,	and by windows have entered,
and betten his wyf, and wounded his doghter with fyve mortal woundes in fyve sondry places --	and beat his wife, and wounded his daughter with five mortal wounds in five different places --
this is to seyn, in hir feet, in hire handes, in hir erys, in hir nose,	this is to say, in her feet, in her hands, in her ears, in her nose,
and in hire mouth -- and leften hire for deed, and wenten awey.	and in her mouth -- and left her for dead, and went away.
Whan Melibeus retourned was into his hous, and saugh al this meschief, he,	When Melibeus had returned into his house, and saw all this mischief, he,
lyk a mad man rentynge his clothes, gan to wepe and crie.	like a mad man tearing his clothes, began to weep and cry.
Prudence, his wyf, as ferforth as she dorste, bisoghte hym of his wepyng for to stynte,	Prudence, his wife, insofar as she dared, besought him to stop his weeping.
but nat forthy he gan to crie and wepen evere lenger the moore.	but nevertheless he began to cry and the longer he wept the more he wept.
This noble wyf Prudence remembred hire upon the sentence of Ovide, in his book	This noble wife Prudence remembered the saying of Ovid, in his book
that cleped is the Remedie of Love, where as he seith,	that is called the Remedy of Love, where he says
"He is a fool that destourbeth the mooder to wepen in the deeth of hire child	"He is a fool that stops the mother from weeping on the death of her child
til she have wept hir fille as for a certein tyme,	until she has wept her fill as for a certain time,
and thanne shal man doon his diligence with amyable wordes hire to reconforte,	and then shall one do his best efforts with amiable words to comfort her,
and preyen hire of hir wepyng for to stynte."	and pray her of her weeping to stint."
For which resoun this noble wyf Prudence suffred hir housbonde	For which reason this noble wife Prudence allowed her husband
for to wepe and crie as for a certein space,	to weep and cry as for a certain amount of time,
and whan she saugh hir tyme, she seyde hym in this wise:	and when she saw her opportunity, she said to him in this manner:
"Allas, my lord," quod she, "why make ye youreself for to be lyk a fool?	"Alas, my lord," said she, "why do you make yourself to be like a fool?
For sothe it aperteneth nat to a wys man to maken swich a sorwe.	For truly it does not befit a wise man to make such a sorrow.
Youre doghter, with the grace of God, shal warisshe and escape.	Your daughter, with the grace of God, shall recover and escape.
And, al were it so that she right now were deed,	And, even if it were so that she right now were dead,
ye ne oughte nat, as for hir deeth, youreself to destroye.	you ought not, for her death, to destroy yourself.
Senek seith: `The wise man shal nat take to greet disconfort for the deeth of his children,	Seneca says: `The wise man shall not take too great discomfort for the death of his children,
but, certes, he sholde suffren it in pacience	but, certainly, he should suffer it in patience
as wel as he abideth the deeth of his owene propre persone.'"	as well as he abides the death of his own self.'"
This Melibeus answerde anon and seyde, "What man," quod he, "sholde of his wepyng stente	This Melibeus answered immediately and said, "What man," said he, "should stint of his weeping
that hath so greet a cause for to wepe?	who has such a good reason to weep?
Jhesu Crist, oure Lord, hymself wepte for the deeth of Lazarus hys freend."	Jesus Christ, our Lord, himself wept for the death of Lazarus his friend."
Prudence answerde: "Certes, wel I woot attempree wepyng is no thyng deffended to hym that sorweful is,	Prudence answered: "Certainly, I know well that moderate weeping is in no way forbidden to him who is sorrowful,
amonges folk in sorwe, but it is rather graunted hym to wepe.	amongst folk in sorrow, but it is rather granted to him to weep.
The Apostle Paul unto the Romayns writeth, `Man shal rejoyse	The Apostle Paul unto the Romans writes, `One shall rejoice
with hem that maken joye and wepen with swich folk as wepen.'	with those who make joy and weep with such folk as weep.'
But though attempree wepyng be ygraunted, outrageous wepyng certes is deffended.	But though moderate weeping is granted, excessive weeping certainly is forbidden.
Mesure of wepyng sholde be considered after the loore that techeth us Senek:	Moderation in weeping should be considered in the light of the lore that Seneca teaches us:
`Whan that thy frend is deed,' quod he, `lat nat thyne eyen to moyste been of teeris,	`When thy friend is dead,' said he, `let not thine eyes be too moist of tears,
ne to muche drye; although the teeris come to thyne eyen, lat hem nat falle;	nor too much dry; although the tears come to thine eyes, let them not fall;
and whan thou hast forgoon thy freend, do diligence to gete another freend;	and when thou hast lost thy friend, make an effort to get another friend;
and this is moore wysdom than for to wepe for thy freend	and this is more wisdom than to weep for thy friend
which that thou hast lorn, for therinne is no boote.'	whom thou hast lost, for therein is no remedy.'
And therfore, if ye governe yow by sapience, put awey sorwe out of youre herte.	And therefore, if you govern yourself by wisdom, put away sorrow out of your heart.
Remembre yow that Jhesus Syrak seith, `A man that is joyous and glad in herte,	Remember you that Jesus son of Sirach says, `A man that is joyous and glad in heart,
it hym conserveth florissynge in his age; but soothly sorweful herte maketh his bones drye.'	it conserves him flourishing in his age; but truly sorrowful heart makes his bones dry.'
He seith eek thus, that sorwe in herte sleeth ful many a man.	He says also thus, that sorrow in heart slays very many a man.
Salomon seith that right as motthes in the shepes flees anoyeth to the clothes,	Solomon says that just as moths in the sheep's fleece do harm to the clothes,
and the smale wormes to the tree, right so anoyeth sorwe to the herte.	and the small worms to the tree, just so sorrow does harm to the heart.
Wherfore us oghte, as wel in the deeth of oure children	Wherefore we should, as well in the death of our children
as in the los of oure othere goodes temporels, have pacience.	as in the loss of our other earthly goods, have patience.
Remembre yow upon the pacient Job. Whan he hadde lost his children and his temporeel substance,	Remember the patient Job. When he had lost his children and his earthly property,
and in his body endured and receyved ful many a grevous tribulacion, yet seyde he thus:	and in his body endured and received very many a grievous tribulation, yet said he thus:
`Oure Lord hath yeve it me; oure Lord hath biraft it me; right as oure Lord hath wold,	`Our Lord has given it to me; our Lord hath taken it from me; just as our Lord wished,
right so it is doon; blessed be the name of oure Lord!'"	just so it is done; blessed be the name of our Lord!'"
To thise forseide thynges answerde Melibeus unto his wyf Prudence: "Alle thy wordes," quod he,	To these foresaid things answered Melibeus unto his wife Prudence: "All thy words," said he,
"been sothe and therto profitable, but trewely myn herte is troubled with this sorwe	"are true and furthermore beneficial, but truly my heart is troubled with this sorrow
so grevously that I noot what to doone."	so grievously that I know not what to do."
"Lat calle," quod Prudence, "thy trewe freendes alle and thy lynage whiche that been wise. Telleth youre cas,	"Have summoned," said Prudence, "all thy true friends and of thy family those that are wise. Tell your case,
and herkneth what they seye in conseillyng, and yow governe after hire sentence.	and hearken what they say in advising, and govern yourself according to their advice."
Salomon seith, `Werk alle thy thynges by conseil, and thou shalt never repente.'"	Solomon says, `Do all thy business by taking advice, and thou shalt never repent.'"
Thanne, by the conseil of his wyf Prudence, this Melibeus leet callen a greet congregacion of folk,	Then, by the advice of his wife Prudence, this Melibeus had called up a great congregation of folk,
as surgiens, phisiciens, olde folk and yonge, and somme of his olde enemys reconsiled	such as surgeons, physicians, old folk and young, and some of his old enemies reconciled
as by hir semblaunt to his love and into his grace;	(as it seemed by their appearance) to his love and into his grace;
and therwithal ther coomen somme of his neighebores that diden hym reverence	and therewithal there came some of his neighbors that did him reverence
moore for drede than for love, as it happeth ofte.	more for dread than for love, as it often happens.
Ther coomen also ful many subtille flatereres and wise advocatz lerned in the lawe.	There came also very many subtle flatterers and wise advocates learned in the law.
And whan this folk togidre assembled weren, this Melibeus in sorweful wise shewed hem his cas.	And when this folk were assembled together, this Melibeus in sorrowful manner showed them his case.
And by the manere of his speche it semed that in herte he baar a crueel ire,	And by the manner of his speech it seemed that in heart he bore a cruel anger,
redy to doon vengeaunce upon his foes, and sodeynly desired that the werre sholde bigynne;	ready to do vengeance upon his foes, and desired that the war should begin very soon;
but nathelees, yet axed he hire conseil upon this matiere.	but nevertheless, yet he asked their advice upon this matter.
A surgien, by licence and assent of swiche as weren wise, up roos	A surgeon, by permission and assent of such as were wise, stood up
and to Melibeus seyde as ye may heere:	and to Melibeus said as you can hear:
"Sire," quod he, "as to us surgiens aperteneth that we do to every wight the beste that we kan,	"Sir," said he, "as to us surgeons it is our duty that we do to every person the best that we can,
where as we been withholde, and to oure pacientz that we do no damage,	where we are employed, and to our patients that we do no damage,
wherfore it happeth many tyme and ofte that whan twey men han everich wounded oother,	because of which it happens many times and often that when two men have each one wounded the other,
oon same surgien heeleth hem bothe;	one same surgeon heals them both;
wherfore unto oure art it is nat pertinent to norice werre ne parties to supporte.	therefore unto our art it is not fitting to nourish war nor to support warring factions.
But certes, as to the warisshynge of youre doghter, al be it so that she perilously be wounded,	But certainly, as to the curing of your daughter, although it be so that she is perilously wounded,
we shullen do so ententif bisynesse fro day to nyght that with the grace of God	we shall do such diligent work from day to night that with the grace of God
she shal be hool and sound as soone as is possible."	she shall be whole and sound as soon as is possible."
Almoost right in the same wise the phisiciens answerden, save that they seyden a fewe woordes moore:	Almost in just the same way the physicians answered, save that they said a few words more:
that right as maladies been cured by hir contraries, right so shul men warisshe werre by vengeaunce.	that just as maladies are cured by their contraries, just so shall men cure war by vengeance.
His neighebores ful of envye, his feyned freendes that semeden reconsiled, and his flatereres	His neighbors full of envy, his feigned friends that seemed reconciled, and his flatterers
maden semblant of wepyng, and empeireden and agreggeden muchel of this matiere in preisynge	made an outward show of weeping, and worsened and much aggravated this matter in praising
greetly Melibee of myght, of power, of richesse, and of freendes, despisynge the power of his adversaries,	greatly Melibee of might, of power, of riches, and of friends, despising the power of his adversaries,
and seiden outrely that he anon sholde wreken hym on his foes and bigynne werre.	and said flatly that he immediately should avenge himself on his foes and begin war.
Up roos thanne an advocat that was wys,	Up rose then an advocate that was wise,
by leve and by conseil of othere that were wise, and seide:	by leave and by advice of others that were wise, and said:
"Lordynges, the nede for which we been assembled in this place	"Gentlemen, the urgent matter for which we are assembled in this place
is a ful hevy thyng and an heigh matiere,	is a very serious thing and an important matter,
by cause of the wrong and of the wikkednesse that hath be doon,	because of the wrong and of the wickedness that has been done,
and eek by resoun of the grete damages that in tyme comynge	and also by reason of the great damages that in time coming
been possible to fallen for this same cause,	are possible to befall for this same cause,
and eek by resoun of the grete richesse and power of the parties bothe,	and also because of the great riches and power of both the parties,
for the whiche resouns it were a ful greet peril to erren in this matiere.	for the which reasons it would be a very great peril to err in this matter.
Wherfore, Melibeus, this is oure sentence: we conseille yow aboven alle thyng	Wherefore, Melibeus, this is our opinion: we advise you above all things
that right anon thou do thy diligence in kepynge of thy propre persone in swich a wise	that right away thou do thy best efforts in keeping of thy own self in such a way
that thou ne wante noon espie ne wacche thy persone for to save.	that thou not lack any spy nor guard in order to save thy person.
And after that, we conseille that in thyn hous thou sette sufficeant garnisoun	And after that, we advise that in thy house thou set sufficient garrison
so that they may as wel thy body as thyn hous defende.	so that they can defend as well thy body as thy house.
But certes, for to moeve werre, ne sodeynly for to doon vengeaunce, we may nat demen	But certainly, to begin war, or suddenly to do vengeance, we can not decide
in so litel tyme that it were profitable.	in so little time that it would be to our advantage.
Wherfore we axen leyser and espace to have deliberacion in this cas to deme.	Therefore we ask leisure and opportunity to have deliberation in this case to judge.
For the commune proverbe seith thus: `He that soone deemeth, soone shal repente.'	For the common proverb says thus: `He that soon judges, soon shall repent.'
And eek men seyn that thilke juge is wys that soone understondeth a matiere and juggeth by leyser;	And also men say that that judge is wise fhat soon understands a matter and judges at leisure;
for al be it so that alle tariyng be anoyful,	for although it be so that all tarrying is bothersome,
algates it is nat to repreve in yevynge of juggement ne in vengeance takyng,	it is not always to be reproved in giving of judgment nor in vengeance taking,
whan it is sufficeant and resonable.	when it is sufficient and reasonable.
And that shewed oure Lord Jhesu Crist by ensample, for whan that the womman that was taken in avowtrie	And that showed our Lord Jesus Christ by example, for when the woman that was taken in adultery
was broght in his presence to knowen what sholde be doon with hire persone, al be it so that	was brought in his presence to know what should be done with her person, although it be so that
he wiste wel hymself what that he wolde answere, yet ne wolde he nat answere sodeynly,	he knew well hmself what he would answer, yet he would not answer suddenly,
but he wolde have deliberacion, and in the ground he wroot twies.	but he would have deliberation, and in the ground he wrote twice.
And by thise causes we axen deliberacioun, and we shal thanne, by the grace of God, conseille thee	And by these causes we ask time for deliberation, and we shall then, by the grace of God, advise thee
thyng that shal be profitable."	something that shall be beneficial."
Up stirten thanne the yonge folk atones, and the mooste partie of that compaignye han scorned this olde wise	Up jumped then the young folk at once, and the most part of that company have scorned this old wise man

right so as whil that iren is hoot men sholden smyte,	just so as while that iron is hot men should smite,
right so men sholde wreken hir wronges whil that they been fresshe and newe;	just so men should avenge their wrongs while they are fresh and new;
and with loud voys they criden "Werre! Werre!"	and with loud voice they cried "War! War!"

"Lordynges," quod he, "ther is ful many a man that crieth `Werre, werre!'	"Gentlemen," said he, "there is very many a man that cries `War, war!'
that woot ful litel what werre amounteth.	who knows very little what war amounts to.
Werre at his bigynnyng hath so greet an entryng and so large that every wight may entre	War at its beginning has so big an entryway and so large that every person may enter
whan hym liketh and lightly fynde werre;	when he pleases and easily find war;
but certes what ende that shal therof bifalle, it is nat light to knowe.	but certainly what end that shall consequently befall, it is not easy to know.
For soothly, whan that werre is ones bigonne, ther is ful many a child unborn of his mooder	For truly, when war is once begun, there is very many a child unborn of his mother
that shal sterve yong by cause of thilke werre, or elles lyve in sorwe and dye in wrecchednesse.	that shall die young because of that same war, or else live in sorrow and die in wretchedness.
And therfore, er that any werre bigynne, men moste have greet conseil and greet deliberacion."	And therefore, ere any war begin, men must have much advice and much deliberation."
And whan this olde man wende to enforcen his tale by resons, wel ny alle atones bigonne they	And when this old man intended to reinforce his argument by reasons, well nigh all at once they began
to rise for to breken his tale, and beden hym ful ofte his wordes for to abregge.	to rise to interrupt his speech, and very often prayed him to abridge his argument.
For soothly, he that precheth to hem that listen nat heeren his wordes, his sermon hem anoieth.	For truly, he who preaches to those who do not want to hear his words, his sermon annoys them.
For Jhesus Syrak seith that "musik in wepynge is a noyous thyng"; this is to seyn:	For Jesus son of Sirach says that "music in weeping is an annoying thing"; this is to say:
as muche availleth to speken bifore folk to which his speche anoyeth	it as much avails to speak before folk whom his speech annoys
as it is to synge biforn hym that wepeth.	as it is to sing before him who weeps.
And whan this wise man saugh that hym wanted audience, al shamefast he sette hym doun agayn.	And when this wise man saw that he lacked an audience, all shame-fast he set himself down again.
For Salomon seith: "Ther as thou ne mayst have noon audience, enforce thee nat to speke."	For Solomon says: "Where thou can not have any audience, force thyself not to speak."
"I see wel," quod this wise man, "that the commune proverbe is sooth, that	"I see well," said this wise man, "that the common proverb is true, that
`good conseil wanteth whan it is moost nede.'"	`good advice is lacking when it is most needed.'"
Yet hadde this Melibeus in his conseil many folk that prively in his eere conseilled hym certeyn thyng,	Yet had this Melibeus among his advisors many folk that secretly in his ear advised him on certain matters,
and conseilled hym the contrarie in general audience.	and advised him the contrary in the hearing of all.
Whan Melibeus hadde herd that the gretteste partie of his conseil weren accorded that he sholde maken werre,	When Melibeus had heard that the greatest part of his advisors were agreed that he should make war,
anoon he consented to hir conseillyng and fully affermed hire sentence.	immediately he consented to their advice and fully affirmed their opinion.
Thanne dame Prudence, whan that she saugh how that hir housbonde shoop hym for to wreken hym on his	Then dame Prudence, when she saw how her husband prepared himself to avenge himself on his
foes and to bigynne werre, she in ful humble wise, whan she saugh hir tyme, seide to hym thise wordes:	foes and to begin war, she in very humble manner, when she saw her time, said to him these words:
"My lord," quod she, "I yow biseche, as hertely as I dar and kan,	"My lord," said she, "I beseech you, as heartily as I dare and can,
ne haste yow nat to faste and, for alle gerdons, as yeveth me audience.	do not hasten yourself too fast and, as you hope to prosper, give me a hearing.
For Piers Alfonce seith, `Whoso that dooth to thee oother good or harm, haste thee nat to quiten it,	For Petrus Alphonsus says, `Whoever does to thee either good or harm, hasten thee not to requite it,
for in this wise thy freend wole abyde and thyn enemy shal the lenger lyve in drede.'	for in this manner thy friend will abide and thine enemy shall the longer live in dread.'
The proverbe seith, `He hasteth wel that wisely kan abyde,' and `in wikked haste is no profit.'"	The proverb says, `He hastens well that wisely can abide,' and `in wicked haste is no benefit.'"
This Melibee answerde unto his wyf Prudence: "I purpose nat," quod he, "to werke by thy conseil,	This Melibee answered unto his wife Prudence: "I do not intend," said he, "to work according to thy advice,
for many causes and resouns. For certes, every wight wolde holde me thanne a fool;	for many causes and reasons. For certainly, every person would hold me then a fool;
this is to seyn, if I, for thy conseillyng, wolde chaungen	this is to say, if I, for thy advice, would change
thynges that been ordeyned and affermed by so manye wyse.	things that are ordained and affirmed by so many wise men.
Secoundely, I seye that alle wommen been wikke, and noon good of hem alle.	Secondly, I say that all women are wicked, and not one good of them all.
For `of a thousand men,' seith Salomon, `I foond o good man, but certes,	For `of a thousand men,' says Solomon, `I found one good man, but certainly,
of alle wommen, good womman foond I nevere.'	of all women, a good woman found I never.'
And also, certes, if I governed me by thy conseil,	And also, certainly, if I governed myself according to thy advice,
it sholde seme that I hadde yeve to thee over me the maistrie,	it should seem that I had given to thee the mastery over me,
and God forbede that it so weere!	and God forbid that it were so!
For Jhesus Syrak seith that `if the wyf have maistrie, she is contrarious to hir housbonde.'	For Jesus son of Sirach says that `if the wife have mastery, she is contrary to her husband.'
And Salomon seith: `Nevere in thy lyf to thy wyf, ne to thy child, ne to thy freend	And Solomon says: `Never in thy life to thy wife, nor to thy child, nor to thy friend
ne yeve no power over thyself, for bettre it were that thy children	give any power over thyself, for it would be better that thy children
aske of thy persone thynges that hem nedeth than thou see thyself	ask of thy person things that they need than that thou see thyself
in the handes of thy children.'	in the hands of thy children.'
And also if I wolde werke by thy conseillyng, certes, my conseil moste som tyme be secree,	And also if I would work according to thy advice, certainly, my counsel must some times be secret,
til it were tyme that it moste be knowe, and this ne may noght be.	until it were time that it must be known, and this may not be.
Whanne dame Prudence, ful debonairly and with greet pacience, hadde herd al that hir housbonde	When dame Prudence, very debonairly and with great patience, had heard all that her husband
 liked for to seye, thanne axed she of hym licence for to speke, and seyde in this wise:	was pleased to say, then she asked of him permission to speak, and said in this manner:
"My lord," quod she, "as to youre firste resoun, certes it may lightly been answered. For I seye that	"My lord," said she, "as to your first reason, certainly it may easily be answered. For I say that
it is no folie to chaunge conseil whan the thyng is chaunged,	it is no folly to change one's plans when the situation is changed,
or elles whan the thyng semeth ootherweyes than it was biforn.	or else when the matter seems other than it was before.
And mooreover, I seye that though ye han sworn and bihight to perfourne	And moreover, I say that though you have sworn and promised to accomplish
 youre emprise, and nathelees ye weyve	your undertaking, and nevertheless you abandon
to perfourne thilke same emprise by juste cause, men sholde nat seyn therfore that ye were a liere ne forsworn.	performing that same undertaking for a good reason, men should not say therefore that you are a liar nor forsworn.
For the book seith that `the wise man maketh no lesyng whan he turneth his corage to the bettre.'	For the book says that `the wise man tells no lie when he turns his inclination to the better.'
And al be it so that youre emprise be establissed and ordeyned by greet multitude of folk,	And although it be so that your undertaking is established and decided upon by a great multitude of folk,
yet thar ye nat accomplice thilke ordinaunce but yow like.	yet you need not carry out that plan unless you want to.
For the trouthe of thynges and the profit been rather founden in fewe folk that been wise and	For the truth of things and the benefit are rather found in few folk that are wise and
ful of resoun than by greet multitude of folk ther every man crieth and clatereth what that hym liketh.	full of reason than by a great multitude of folk where every man cries and babbles what he pleases.
Soothly swich multitude is nat honest.	Truly such a multitude is not honorable.
And as to the seconde resoun, where as ye seyn that alle wommen been wikke;	And as to the second reason, where you say that all women are wicked;
save youre grace, certes ye despisen alle wommen in this wyse, and	with all due respect to you, certainly you despise all women in this manner, and
`he that al despiseth, al displeseth,' as seith the book.	`he who despises all, displeases all,' as says the book.
And Senec seith that `whoso wole have sapience shal no man dispreyse,	And Seneca says that `whosoever will have wisdom shall no man disparage,
but he shal gladly techen the science that he kan withouten presumpcion or pride;	but he shall gladly teach the knowledge that he knows without presumption or pride;
and swiche thynges as he noght ne kan, he shal nat been ashamed to lerne hem,	and such things of which he knows nothing, he should not be ashamed to learn them,
and enquere of lasse folk than hymself.'	and ask for advice from lesser folk than himself.'
And, sire, that ther hath been many a good womman may lightly be preved.	And, sir, that there has been many a good woman may easily be proven.
For certes, sire, oure Lord Jhesu Crist wolde nevere have descended to be born of a womman,	For certainly, sir, our Lord Jesus Christ would never have condescended to be born of a woman,
if alle wommen hadden been wikke.	if all women had been wicked.
And after that, for the grete bountee that is in wommen,	And after that, for the great goodness that is in women,
oure Lord Jhesu Crist, whan he was risen fro deeth to lyve,	our Lord Jesus Christ, when he was risen from death to life,
appeered rather to a womman than to his Apostles.	appeared to a woman rather than to his Apostles.
And though that Salomon seith that he ne foond nevere womman good,	And though Solomon says that he never found a good woman,
it folweth nat therfore that alle wommen ben wikke.	it follows not therefore that all women are wicked.
For though that he ne foond no good womman, certes,	For though he found no good woman, certainly,
many another man hath founden many a womman ful good and trewe.	many another man has found many a woman very good and true.
Or elles, per aventure, the entente of Salomon was this:	Or else, possibly, the intent of Solomon was this:
that, as in sovereyn bounte, he foond no womman --	that, in supreme goodness, he found no woman --
this is to seyn, that ther is no wight that hath sovereyn bountee save God allone,	this is to say, that there is no creature who has supreme goodness save God alone,
as he hymself recordeth in hys Evaungelie.	as he himself records in his Gospels.
For ther nys no creature so good that hym ne wanteth	For there is no creature so good that he does not lack
somwhat of the perfeccioun of God, that is his makere.	something of the perfection of God, who is his maker.
Youre thridde reson is this: ye seyn that if ye governe yow by my conseil,	Your third reason is this: you say that if you govern yourself by my advice,
it sholde seme that ye hadde yeve me the maistrie and the lordshipe over youre persone.	it should seem that you had given me the mastery and the lordship over your person.
Sire, save youre grace, it is nat so. For if it so were that no man sholde be conseilled	Sir, with all due respect to you, it is not so. For if it were true that no man should be advised
but oonly of hem that hadden lordshipe and maistrie of his persone, men wolden nat be conseilled so ofte.	but only of them that had lordship and mastery of his person, men would not be advised so often.
For soothly thilke man that asketh conseil of a purpos, yet hath he free choys	For truly that man who asks advice about a plan, yet has free choice
wheither he wole werke by that conseil or noon.	whether he will follow by that advice or non.
And as to youre fourthe resoun, ther ye seyn that the janglerie of wommen kan hyde thynges that they	And as to your fourth reason, where you say that the gossip of women can hide things that they
wot noght, as who seith that a womman kan nat hyde that she woot;	know not, as who says that a woman can not hide what she knows;
sire, thise wordes been understonde of wommen that been jangleresses and wikked;	sir, these words are understood of women that are gossips and wicked;
of whiche wommen men seyn that thre thynges dryven a man out of his hous --	of which women men say that three things drive a man out of his house --
that is to seyn, smoke, droppyng of reyn, and wikked wyves;	that is to say, smoke, dropping of rain, and wicked wives;
and of swiche wommen seith Salomon that	and of such women says Solomon that
`it were bettre dwelle in desert than with a womman that is riotous.'	`it were better dwell in desert than with a woman that is dissolute.'
And sire, by youre leve, that am nat I,	And sir, by your leave, that am not I,
for ye han ful ofte assayed my grete silence and my grete pacience, and eek how wel that	for you have very often tested my great silence and my great patience, and also how well that
I kan hyde and hele thynges that men oghte secreely to hyde.	I can hide and conceal things that men ought secretly to hide.
And soothly, as to youre fifthe resoun, where as ye seyn that in wikked conseil wommen venquisshe men,	And truly, as to your fifth reason, where you say that in wicked advice women vanquish men,
God woot, thilke resoun stant heere in no stede.	God knows, that reason has no value here.
For understoond now, ye asken conseil to do wikkednesse;	For understand now, you ask advice to do wickedness;
and if ye wole werken wikkednesse, and youre wif restreyneth thilke wikked purpos,	and if you will do wickedness, and your wife restrains that wicked purpose,
and overcometh yow by reson and by good conseil,	and overcomes you by reason and by good advice,
certes youre wyf oghte rather to be preised than yblamed.	certainly your wife ought rather to be praised than blamed.
Thus sholde ye understonde the philosophre that seith, `In wikked conseil wommen venquisshen hir housbondes.'	Thus should you understand the philosopher that says, `In wicked advice women vanquish their husbands.'
And ther as ye blamen alle wommen and hir resouns, I shal shewe yow by manye ensamples that	And whereas you blame all women and their reasons, I shall show you by many examples that
many a womman hath ben ful good, and yet been, and hir conseils ful hoolsome and profitable.	many a woman has been very good, and yet are, and their advices very wholesome and beneficial.
Eek som men han seyd that the conseillynge of wommen	Also some men have said that the counsel of women
is outher to deere or elles to litel of pris.	is either too expensive or else too little of price.
But al be it so that ful many a womman is badde and hir conseil vile and noght worth,	But although it be so that very many a woman is bad and her advice vile and not worthy,
yet han men founde ful many a good womman, and ful discret and wis in conseillynge.	yet have men found very many a good woman, and very discrete and wise in giving counsel.
Loo, Jacob by good conseil of his mooder Rebekka wan the benysoun of Ysaak his fader	Lo, Jacob by the good advice of his mother Rebecca won the blessing of Isaac his fader
and the lordshipe over alle his bretheren.	and the lordship over all his brethren.
Judith by hire good conseil delivered the citee of Bethulie, in which she dwelled,	Judith by her good advice delivered the city of Bethulia, in which she dwelled,
out of the handes of Olofernus, that hadde it biseged and wolde have al destroyed it.	out of the hands of Holofernus, who had besieged it and would have entirely destroyed it.
Abygail delivered Nabal hir housbonde fro David the kyng, that wolde have slayn hym,	Abigail delivered Nabal her husband from David the king, who would have slain him,
and apaysed the ire of the kyng by hir wit and by hir good conseillyng.	and appeased the anger of the king by her wit and by her good advice.
Hester by hir good conseil enhaunced greetly the peple of God in the regne of Assuerus the kyng.	Hester by her good counsel advanced greatly the people of God in the reign of Assuerus the king.
And the same bountee in good conseillyng of many a good womman may men telle.	And the same goodness in good advising of many a good woman may men tell.
And mooreover, whan oure Lord hadde creat Adam, oure forme fader, he seyde in this wise:	And moreover, when our Lord had created Adam, our forefather, he said in this manner:
`It is nat good to been a man alloone; make we to hym an helpe semblable to hymself.'	`It is not good to be a man alone; let us make for him a helpmate similar to himself.'
Heere may ye se that if that wommen were nat goode, and hir conseils goode and profitable,	Here may you see that if women were not good, and their advice good and beneficial,
oure Lord God of hevene wolde nevere han wroght hem,	our Lord God of heaven would never have made them,
ne called hem help of man, but rather confusioun of man.	nor called them help of man, but rather confusion of man.
And ther seyde oones a clerk in two vers, `What is bettre than gold? Jaspre.	And there said once a clerk in two verses, `What is better than gold? Jasper.
What is bettre than jaspre? Wisedoom.	What is better than jasper? Wisdom.
And what is better than wisedoom? Womman. And what is bettre than a good womman? Nothyng.'	And what is better than wisdom? Woman. And what is better than a good woman? Nothing.'
And, sire, by manye of othre resons may ye seen that	And, sir, by many other reasons may you see that
manye wommen been goode, and hir conseils goode and profitable.	many women are good, and their advice good and beneficial.
And therfore, sire, if ye wol triste to my conseil, I shal restoore yow youre doghter hool and sound.	And therefore, sir, if you will trust to my advice, I shall restore you your daughter whole and sound.
And eek I wol do to yow so muche that ye shul have honour in this cause."	And also I will do for you so much that you shall have honor in this undertaking."
Whan Melibee hadde herd the wordes of his wyf Prudence, he seyde thus:	When Melibee had heard the words of his wife Prudence, he said thus:
"I se wel that the word of Salomon is sooth.	"I see well that the word of Solomon is sooth.
He seith that `wordes that been spoken discreetly by ordinaunce been honycombes,	He says that `words that are spoken discretely and properly are honeycombs,
for they yeven swetnesse to the soule and hoolsomnesse to the body.'	for they give sweetness to the soul and healthfulness to the body.'
And, wyf, by cause of thy sweete wordes, and eek for I have assayed and preved thy grete sapience	And, wife, because of thy sweet words, and also because I have tested and proven thy great wisdom
and thy grete trouthe, I wol governe me by thy conseil in alle thyng."	and thy great truth, I will govern myself by thy advice in all things."
"Now, sire," quod dame Prudence, "and syn ye vouche sauf to been governed by my conseil,	"Now, sir," said dame Prudence, "and since you consent to be governed by my advice,
I wol enforme yow how ye shul governe yourself in chesynge of youre conseillours.	I will inform you how you shall govern yourself in the choice of your advisors.
Ye shul first in alle youre werkes mekely biseken to the heighe God that he wol be youre conseillour;	You shall first in all your works meekly beseech the high God that he will be your advisor;
and shapeth yow to swich entente that he yeve yow conseil and confort, as taughte Thobie his sone:	and prepare yourself with the aim that he give you advice and comfort, as Tobias taught his son:
`At alle tymes thou shalt blesse God, and praye hym to dresse thy weyes,	`At all times thou shalt bless God, and pray him to prepare thy ways,
and looke that alle thy conseils been in hym for everemoore.'	and look that all thy counsels are in him for evermore.'
Seint Jame eek seith: `If any of yow have nede of sapience, axe it of God.'	Saint James also says: `If any of you have need of wisdom, ask it of God.'
And afterward thanne shul ye taken conseil in youreself,	And afterward then shall you take advice in yourself,
and examyne wel youre thoghtes of swich thyng as yow thynketh that is best for youre profit.	and examine well your thoughts of such thing as it seems to you best for your advantage.
And thanne shul ye dryve fro youre herte thre thynges that been contrariouse to good conseil;	And then shall you drive from your heart three things that are contrary to good advice;
that is to seyn, ire, coveitise, and hastifnesse.	that is to say, anger, greed, and haste.
"First, he that axeth conseil of hymself, certes he moste been withouten ire, for manye causes.	"First, he who asks advice of himself, certainly he must be without anger, for many reasons.
The firste is this: he that hath greet ire and wratthe in hymself, he weneth alwey that	The first is this: he who has great anger and wrath in himself, he supposes always that
he may do thyng that he may nat do.	he can do a thing that he can not do.
And secoundely, he that is irous and wrooth, he ne may nat wel deme;	And secondly, he who is angry and wrathful, he can not well judge;
and he that may nat wel deme, may nat wel conseille.	and he who can not well judge, can not well advise.
The thridde is this, that he that is irous and wrooth, as seith Senec,	The third is this, that he that is angry and wrathful, as says Seneca,
ne may nat speke but blameful thynges,	can not speak anything but blameworthy things,
and with his viciouse wordes he stireth oother folk to angre and to ire.	and with his vicious words he stirs other folk to anger and to ire.
And eek, sire, ye moste dryve coveitise out of youre herte.	And also, sir, you must drive greed out of your heart.
For the Apostle seith that coveitise is roote of alle harmes.	For the Apostle says that greed is root of all harms.
And trust wel that a coveitous man ne kan noght deme ne thynke,	And trust well that a greedy man can neither judge nor think anything,
but oonly to fulfille the ende of his coveitise;	except only to fulfill the object of his greed;
and certes, that ne may nevere been accompliced,	and certainly, that can never be accomplished,
for evere the moore habundaunce that he hath of richesse, the moore he desireth.	for always the more abundance that he has of riches, the more he desires.
And, sire, ye moste also dryve out of youre herte hastifnesse; for certes,	And, sir, you must also drive out of your heart haste; for certainly,
ye ne may nat deeme for the beste by a sodeyn thought that falleth in youre herte,	you can not judge for the best by a sudden thought that falls in your heart,
but ye moste avyse yow on it ful ofte.	but you must reflect upon it very often.
For, as ye herde her biforn, the commune proverbe is this, that `he that soone deemeth, soone repenteth.'	For, as you heard before this, the common proverb is this, that `he who soon judges, soon repents.'
Sire, ye ne be nat alwey in lyk disposicioun;	Sir, you are not always in the same frame of mind;
for certes, somthyng that somtyme semeth to yow that it is good for to do,	for certainly, something that sometimes seems to you that it is good to do,
another tyme it semeth to yow the contrarie.	another time it seems to you the contrary.
"Whan ye han taken conseil in youreself and han deemed by good deliberacion swich thyng as you semeth best,	"When you have pondered the matter and have judged by good deliberation such thing as seems best to you,
thanne rede I yow that ye kepe it secree.	then I advise you that you keep it secret.
Biwrey nat youre conseil to no persone, but if so be that ye wenen sikerly that	Reveal your plans to no person, but if it so be that you believe truly
thurgh youre biwreyyng youre condicioun shal be to yow the moore profitable.	through your revealing your condition shall be to you the more advantageous.
For Jhesus Syrak seith, `Neither to thy foo ne to thy frend discovere nat thy secree ne thy folie,	For Jesus son of Sirach says, `Neither to thy foe nor to thy friend discover not thy secret nor thy folly,
for they wol yeve yow audience and lookynge and supportacioun in thy presence and scorne thee in thyn absence.'	for they will give you audience and attention and support in thy presence and scorn thee in thine absence.'
Another clerk seith that `scarsly shaltou fynden any persone that may kepe conseil secrely.'	Another clerk says that `scarcely shalt thou find any person that can keep plans secretly.'
The book seith, `Whil that thou kepest thy conseil in thyn herte, thou kepest it in thy prisoun,	The book says, `While thou keepest thy plan in thine heart, thou keepest it in thy prison,
and whan thou biwreyest thy conseil to any wight, he holdeth thee in his snare.'	and when thou reveal thy plans to any person, he holds thee in his snare.'
And therfore yow is bettre to hyde youre conseil in youre herte than praye him	And therefore for you it is better to hide your plans in your heart than pray him
to whom ye han biwreyed youre conseil that he wole kepen it cloos and stille.	to whom you have revealed your plans that he will keep it close and still.
For Seneca seith: `If so be that thou ne mayst nat thyn owene conseil hyde,	For Seneca says: `If it so be that thou can not hide thine own plans,
how darstou prayen any oother wight thy conseil secrely to kepe?'	how dare thou pray any other person to keep thy advice secretly?'
But nathelees, if thou wene sikerly that the biwreiyng of thy conseil to a persone wol make	But nevertheless, if thou believe truly that the revealing of thy plans to a person will make
thy condicion to stonden in the bettre plyt, thanne shaltou tellen hym thy conseil in this wise.	thy condition stand in the better condition, then shalt thou tell him thy plans in this manner.
First thou shalt make no semblant wheither thee were levere pees or werre, or this or that,	First thou shalt make no outward sign whether thou would prefer peace or war, or this or that,
ne shewe hym nat thy wille and thyn entente.	nor show him not thy will and thine intent.
For trust wel that comunli thise conseillours been flatereres,	For trust well that commonly these advisors are flatterers,
namely the conseillours of grete lordes,	namely the advisors of great lords,
for they enforcen hem alwey rather to speken plesante wordes, enclynynge to the lordes lust,	for they force themselves always rather to speak pleasant words, inclining to the lord's desire,
than wordes that been trewe or profitable.	than words that are true or beneficial.
And therfore men seyn that the riche man hath seeld good conseil, but if he have it of hymself.	And therefore men say that the rich man has seldom good advice, unless he have it of himself.
And after that thou shalt considere thy freendes and thyne enemys.	And after that thou shalt consider thy friends and thine enemies.
And as touchynge thy freendes, thou shalt considere which of hem been	And as concerning thy friends, thou shalt consider which of them are
moost feithful and moost wise and eldest and most approved in conseillyng;	most faithful and most wise and eldest and most proven in giving advice;
and of hem shalt thou aske thy conseil, as the caas requireth.	and of them shalt thou ask thy advice, as the case requires.
I seye that first ye shul clepe to youre conseil youre freendes that been trewe.	I say that first you shall call to your council your friends that are true.
For Salomon seith that `right as the herte of a man deliteth in savour that is soote,	For Solomon says that `just as the heart of a man delights in taste that is sweet,
right so the conseil of trewe freendes yeveth swetnesse to the soule.'	just so the advice of true friends gives sweetness to the soul.'
He seith also, `Ther may no thyng be likned to the trewe freend,	He says also, `Nothing can be compared to a true friend,
for certes gold ne silver ben nat so muche worth as the goode wyl of a trewe freend.'	for certainly gold nor silver are not worth so much as the good will of a true friend.'
And eek he seith that `a trewe freend is a strong deffense; who so that it fyndeth,	And also he says that `a true friend is a strong defense; whoever finds it,
certes he fyndeth a greet tresour.'	certainly he finds a great treasure.'
Thanne shul ye eek considere if that youre trewe freendes been discrete and wise.	Then shall you also consider whether your true friends are discrete and wise.
For the book seith, `Axe alwey thy conseil of hem that been wise.'	For the book says, `Ask always thy advice of those who are wise.'
And by this same resoun shul ye clepen to youre conseil of youre freendes that been of age,	And by this same reason shall you call to your council some of your friends that are of suitably advanced age,
swiche as han seyn and been expert in manye thynges and been approved in conseillynges.	such as have seen and are expert in many things and are proven in giving advice.
For the book seith that `in olde men is the sapience, and in longe tyme the prudence.'	For the book says that `in old men is the wisdom, and in long time the prudence.
And Tullius seith that `grete thynges ne been nat ay accompliced by strengthe, ne by delivernesse of body, but	And Cicero says that `great things are not always accomplished by strength, nor by agility of body, but
by good conseil, by auctoritee of persones, and by science; the whiche thre thynges ne been nat fieble by age,	by good advice, by a person's power to persuade, and by knowledge; the which three things are not enfeebled by age,
but certes they enforcen and encreescen day by day.'	but certainly they gain strength and increase day by day.'
And thanne shul ye kepe this for a general reule: First shul ye clepen to youre conseil	And then shall you keep this for a general rule: First you shall call to your council
a fewe of youre freendes that been especiale;	a few of your friends who are particularly esteemed;
for Salomon seith, `Manye freendes have thou, but among a thousand chese thee oon to be thy conseillour.'	for Solomon says, `Many friends have thou, but among a thousand chose thyself one to be thy advisor.'
For al be it so that thou first ne telle thy conseil but to a fewe,	For although it be so that thou first tell thy advice only to a few,
thou mayst afterward telle it to mo folk if it be nede.	thou mayst afterward tell it to more folk if it be needed.
But looke alwey that thy conseillours have thilke thre condiciouns that I have seyd bifore --	But look always that thy advisors have those three conditions that I have said before --
that is to seyn, that they be trewe, wise, and of oold experience.	that is to say, that they are true, wise, and of old experience.
And werke nat alwey in every nede by oon counseillour allone;	And work not always in every need by one advisor alone;
for somtyme bihooveth it to been conseilled by manye.	for sometimes it is necessary to be advised by many.
For Salomon seith, `Salvacion of thynges is where as ther been manye conseillours.'	For Solomon says, `Salvation of things is where there are many advisors.'
"Now, sith that I have toold yow of which folk ye sholde been counseilled, now	"Now, since I have told you of which folk you should be advised, now
wol I teche yow which conseil ye oghte to eschewe.	I will teach you which advice you ought to shun.
First, ye shul eschue the conseillyng of fooles; for Salomon seith, `Taak no conseil of a fool,	First, you shall shun the advice of fools; for Solomon says, `Take no counsel of a fool,
for he ne kan noght conseille but after his owene lust and his affeccioun.'	for he can not advise except in accordance with his own desire and his inclination.'
The book seith that `the propretee of a fool is this: he troweth lightly harm of every wight,	The book says that `the characteristic of a fool is this: he easily believes harm of every person,
and lightly troweth alle bountee in hymself.'	and easily believes all goodness in himself.'
Thou shalt eek eschue the conseillyng of alle flatereres, swiche as enforcen hem rather to preise youre persone	Thou shalt also shun the advice of all flatterers, such as exert themselves rather to praise your person
by flaterye than for to telle yow the soothfastnesse of thynges.	by flattery than to tell you the truth of things.
Wherfore Tullius seith, `Amonges alle the pestilences that been in freendshipe the gretteste is flaterie.'	Wherefore Cicero says, `Amongst all the pestilences that are in friendship the greatest is flattery.'
And therfore is it moore nede that thou eschue and drede flatereres than any oother peple.	And therefore is it more needful that thou shun and dread flatterers than any other people.
The book seith, `Thou shalt rather drede and flee fro the sweete wordes of flaterynge preiseres	The book says, `Thou shalt rather dread and flee from the sweet words of flattering praisers
than fro the egre wordes of thy freend that seith thee thy sothes.'	than from the sharp words of thy friend who tells thee thy truths.'
Salomon seith that `the wordes of a flaterere is a snare to cacche with innocentz.'	Solomon says that `the words of a flatterer is a snare with which to catch innocents.'
He seith also that `he that speketh to his freend wordes of swetnesse and of plesaunce	He says also that `he who speaks to his friend words of sweetness and of pleasance
setteth a net biforn his feet to cacche hym.'	sets a net before his feet to catch him.'
And therfore seith Tullius, `Enclyne nat thyne eres to flatereres, ne taak no conseil of the wordes of flaterye.'	And therefore says Cicero, `Incline not thine ears to flatterers, and take no advice of the words of flattery.'
And Caton seith, `Avyse thee wel, and eschue the wordes of swetnesse and of plesaunce.'	And Cato says, `Ponder thee well, and shun the words of sweetness and of pleasance.'
And eek thou shalt eschue the conseillyng of thyne olde enemys that been reconsiled.	And also thou shalt shun the advice of thine old enemies that are reconciled.
The book seith that `no wight retourneth saufly into the grace of his olde enemy.'	The book says that `no person returns safely into the good will of his old enemy.'
And Isope seith, `Ne trust nat to hem to whiche thou hast had som tyme werre or enemytee,	And Aesop says, `Trust not to those with whom thou hast had at some time war or enmity,
ne telle hem nat thy conseil.'	nor tell them not thy plans.'
And Seneca telleth the cause why: `It may nat be,' seith he, `that where greet	And Seneca tells the reason why: `It may not be,' says he, `that where great
fyr hath longe tyme endured, that ther ne dwelleth som vapour of warmnesse.'	fire has long time endured, but that there dwells some vapor of warmness.'
And therfore seith Salomon, `In thyn olde foo trust nevere.'	And therefore says Solomon, `In thine old foe trust never.'
For sikerly, though thyn enemy be reconsiled, and maketh thee chiere of humylitee,	For surely, though thine enemy be reconciled, and makes thee the appearance of humility,
and lowteth to thee with his heed, ne trust hym nevere.	and bows to thee with his head, trust him never.
For certes he maketh thilke feyned humilitee moore for his profit than for any love of thy persone,	For certainly he makes that feigned humility more for his advantage than for any love of thy person,
by cause that he deemeth to have victorie over thy persone by swich feyned contenance,	because he supposes to have victory over thy person by such feigned behavior,
the which victorie he myghte nat have by strif or werre.	the which victory he might not have by strife or war.
And Peter Alfonce seith, `Make no felawshipe with thyne olde enemys, for if thou do hem bountee,	And Petrus Alphnsus says, `Make no fellowship with thine old enemies, for if thou do them goodness,
they wol perverten it into wikkednesse.'	they will pervert it into wickedness.'
And eek thou most eschue the conseillyng of hem that been thy servantz and beren thee greet reverence,	And also thou most shun the advice of those who are thy servants and bear thee great reverence,
for peraventure they seyn it moore for drede than for love.	for perhaps they say it more for dread than for love.
And therfore seith a philosophre in this wise:	And therefore says a philosopher in this manner:
`Ther is no wight parfitly trewe to hym that he to soore dredeth.'	`There is no person perfectly true to him whom he too sorely dreads.'
And Tullius seith, `Ther nys no myght so greet of any emperour that longe may endure,	And Cicero says, `There is no might so great of any emperor that long may endure,
but if he have moore love of the peple than drede.'	unless he has more love of the people than dread.'
Thou shalt also eschue the conseiling of folk that been dronkelewe, for they ne kan no conseil hyde.	Thou shalt also shun the advice of folk that are drunkards, for they nor can hide no plans.
For Salomon seith, `Ther is no privetee ther as regneth dronkenesse.'	For Solomon says, `There is no secrecy where drunkenness reigns.'
Ye shul also han in suspect the conseillyng of swich folk as	You shall also be suspicious of the advice of such folk as
conseille yow o thyng prively and conseille yow the contrarie openly.	advise you one thing privately and counsel you the contrary openly.
For Cassidorie seith that `it is a manere sleighte to hyndre,	For Cassiodorus says that `it is a difficult task to hinder a scheme,
whan he sheweth to doon o thyng openly and werketh prively the contrarie.'	when a person appears to do one thing openly and secretly works the contrary.'
Thou shalt also have in suspect the conseillyng of wikked folk. For the book seith,	Thou shalt also be suspicious of the advice of wicked folk. For the book says,
`The conseillyng of wikked folk is alwey ful of fraude.'	`The advice of wicked folk is always full of fraud.'
And David seith, `Blisful is that man that hath nat folwed the conseilyng of shrewes.'	And David says, `Blissful is that man who has not followed the advice of scoundrels.'
Thou shalt also eschue the conseillyng of yong folk, for hir conseil is nat rype.	Thou shalt also shun the advice of young folk, for their counsel is not ripe.
"Now, sire, sith I have shewed yow of which folk ye shul take youre conseil	"Now, sir, since I have showed you of which folk you shall take your advice
and of which folk ye shul folwe the conseil,	and of which folk you shall follow the advice,
now wol I teche yow how ye shal examyne youre conseil, after the doctrine of Tullius.	now will I teach you how you shall examine your advice, according to the doctrine of Cicero.
In the examynynge thanne of youre conseillour ye shul considere manye thynges.	In the examining then of your advisor you shall consider many things .
Alderfirst thou shalt considere that in thilke thyng that thou purposest, and upon what thyng thou wolt have conseil,	First of all thou shalt consider that in that thing that thou intendest, and upon which thing thou will have advice,
that verray trouthe be seyd and conserved; this is to seyn, telle trewely thy tale.	that real truth be said and preserved; this is to say, tell truly thy tale.
For he that seith fals may nat wel be conseilled in that cas of which he lieth.	For he that speaks falsely may not well be advised in that case of which he lies.
And after this thou shalt considere the thynges that acorden to that thou purposest	And after this thou shalt consider the things that agree with that thou intendest
for to do by thy conseillours, if resoun accorde therto,	for to act as thy advisors advise, if reason accord thereto,
and eek if thy myght may atteine therto, and if the moore part	and also if thy might can attain thereto, and if the larger part
and the bettre part of thy conseillours acorde therto, or noon.	and the better part of thy advisors accord thereto, or not.
Thanne shaltou considere what thyng shal folwe of that conseillyng,	Then shalt thou consider what thing shall follow from that advice,
as hate, pees, werre, grace, profit, or damage, and manye othere thynges.	as hate, peace, war, grace, profit, or damage, and many other things.
And in alle thise thynges thou shalt chese the beste and weyve alle othere thynges.	And in all these things thou shalt chose the best and abandon all other things .
Thanne shaltow considere of what roote is engendred the matiere of thy conseil	Then shalt thou consider of what root is engendered the matter of thy advice
and what fruyt it may conceyve and engendre.	and what fruit it may conceive and engender.
Thou shalt eek considere alle thise causes, fro whennes they been sprongen.	Thou shalt also consider all these causes, from whence they are sprung.
And whan ye han examyned youre conseil, as I have seyd, and which partie is the bettre	And when you have examined your advice, as I have said, and (decided) which part is the better
and moore profitable, and han approved it by manye wise folk and olde,	and more beneficial, and have tested it by many wise and old folk,
thanne shaltou considere if thou mayst parfourne it and maken of it a good ende.	then shalt thou consider if thou can perform it and make of it a good end.
For certes resoun wol nat that any man sholde bigynne a thyng	For certainly reason will not desire that any man should begin a thing
but if he myghte parfourne it as hym oghte;	unless he might perform it as he ought to;
ne no wight sholde take upon hym so hevy a charge that he myghte nat bere it.	nor no person should take upon him so heavy a charge that he might not bear it.
For the proverbe seith, `He that to muche embraceth, distreyneth litel.'	For the proverb says, `He who too much embraces, keeps little.'
And Catoun seith, `Assay to do swich thyng as thou hast power to doon,	And Cato says, `Try to do such thing as thou hast power to do,
lest that the charge oppresse thee so soore that	lest that the charge oppress thee so sorely that
thee bihoveth to weyve thyng that thou hast bigonne.'	thou art compelled to abandon an undertaking that thou hast begun.'
And if so be that thou be in doute wheither thou mayst parfourne a thing or noon,	And if it so be that thou art in doubt about whether thou can perform a thing or not,
chese rather to suffre than bigynne.	choose rather to suffer than begin.
And Piers Alphonce seith, `If thou hast myght to doon a thyng of which thou most repente,	And Petrus Alphonsus says, `If thou hast might to do a thing of which thou must repent,
it is bettre "nay" than "ye."'	it is better "nay" than "yea."'
This is to seyn, that thee is bettre holde thy tonge stille than for to speke.	This is to say, that for thee it is better hold thy tongue still than to speak.
Thanne may ye understonde by strenger resons that if thou hast power to parfourne a werk	Then may you understand by stronger reasons that if thou hast power to perform a work
of which thou shalt repente, thanne is it bettre that thou suffre than bigynne.	of which thou shalt repent, then is it better that thou suffer than begin.
Wel seyn they that defenden every wight to assaye a thyng of which he is in doute	Well say they who forbid every person to attempt a thing of which he is in doubt
wheither he may parfourne it or noon.	whether he can perform it or not.
And after, whan ye han examyned youre conseil, as I have seyd biforn, and knowen wel that	And after, when you have examined your advice, as I have said before, and know well that
ye may parfourne youre emprise, conferme it thanne sadly til it be at an ende.	you can perform your enterprise, prosecute it then diligently until it be at an end.
"Now is it resoun and tyme that I shewe yow whanne and wherfore that	"Now is it reasonable and time that I show you when and wherefore that
ye may chaunge youre counseil withouten youre repreve.	you may change your plans without earning dishonor.
Soothly, a man may chaungen his purpos and his conseil if the cause cesseth,	Truly, a man may change his purpose and his plans if the cause ceases,
or whan a newe caas bitydeth.	or when a new case befalls.
For the lawe seith that `upon thynges that newely bityden bihoveth newe conseil.'	For the law says that `things that newly befall require new plans.'
And Senec seith, `If thy conseil is comen to the eeris of thyn enemy, chaunge thy conseil.'	And Seneca says, `If thy plan is come to the ears of thine enemy, change thy plan.'
Thou mayst also chaunge thy conseil if so be that thou fynde that by errour,	Thou mayst also change thy plan if it so be that thou find that by error,
or by oother cause, harm or damage may bityde.	or by other cause, harm or damage may befall.
Also if thy conseil be dishonest, or ellis cometh of dishonest cause, chaunge thy conseil.	Also if thy plan be unjust, or else comes of dishonest cause, change thy plan.
For the lawes seyn that `alle bihestes that been dishoneste been of no value';	For the laws say that `all promises that are dishonest are of no value';
and eek if so be that it be inpossible, or may nat goodly be parfourned or kept.	and also if it so be that it is impossible, or can not goodly be performed or kept.
"And take this for a general reule, that every conseil that is affermed so strongly that it may nat	"And take this for a general rule, that every plan that is affirmed so strongly that it may not
be chaunged for no condicioun that may bityde, I seye that thilke conseil is wikked."	be changed for any condition that may befall, I say that that plan is wicked."
This Melibeus, whanne he hadde herd the doctrine of his wyf dame Prudence, answerde in this wyse:	This Melibeus, when he had heard the doctrine of his wife dame Prudence, answered in this wise:
"Dame," quod he, "as yet into this tyme ye han wel and covenably taught me as in general how	"Dame," said he, "as yet until this time you have well and fittingly taught me as in general how
I shal governe me in the chesynge and in the withholdynge of my conseillours.	I should govern myself in the choice and in the retention of my advisors.
But now wolde I fayn that ye wolde condescende in especial	But now would I eagerly desire that you would get down to particulars
and telle me how liketh yow, or what semeth yow, by oure conseillours	and tell me how you like it, or what it seems to you, concerning our advisors
that we han chosen in oure present nede."	that we have chosen in our present need."
"My lord," quod she, "I biseke yow in al humblesse that ye wol nat wilfully replie agayn my resouns,	"My lord," said she, "I beseech you in all humility that you will not willfully reply against my arguments,
ne distempre youre herte, thogh I speke thyng that yow displese.	nor upset your heart, though I speak something that may displease you.
For God woot that, as in myn entente, I speke it for youre beste,	For God knows that, in my intent, I speak it for your best,
for youre honour, and for youre profite eke.	for your honor, and for your benefit also.
And soothly, I hope that youre benyngnytee wol taken it in pacience.	And truly, I hope that your benignity will take it in patience.
Trusteth me wel," quod she, "that youre conseil as in this caas ne sholde nat, as to speke properly,	Trust me well," said she, "that your advice in this case should not, to speak properly,
be called a conseillyng, but a mocioun or a moevyng of folye,	be called an advising, but a motion or a moving of folly,
in which conseil ye han erred in many a sondry wise.	in which advice you have erred in many a different way.
"First and forward, ye han erred in th' assemblynge of youre conseillours.	"First of all, you have erred in the assembling of your advisors.
For ye sholde first have cleped a fewe folk to youre conseil, and after ye myghte han shewed it	For you should first have called a few folk to your council, and after you might have showed it
to mo folk, if it hadde been nede.	to more folk, if it had been necessary.
But certes, ye han sodeynly cleped to youre conseil a greet multitude of peple,	But certainly, you have suddenly called to your council a great multitude of people,
ful chargeant and ful anoyous for to heere.	very burdensome and very annoying to hear.
Also ye han erred, for theras ye sholden oonly have cleped to youre conseil	Also you have erred, for whereas you should only have called to your council
youre trewe frendes olde and wise,	your true friends old and wise,
ye han ycleped straunge folk, yonge folk, false flatereres, and enemys reconsiled,	you have called foreign folk, young folk, false flatterers, and enemies reconciled,
and folk that doon yow reverence withouten love.	and folk who do you reverence without love.
And eek also ye have erred, for ye han broght with yow to youre conseil ire, coveitise, and hastifnesse,	And also you have erred, for you have brought with you to your council anger, greed, and haste,
the whiche thre thinges been contrariouse to every conseil honest and profitable;	the which three things are contrary to every council honorable and beneficial;
the whiche thre thinges ye han nat anientissed or destroyed hem,	the which three things you have not annihilated or destroyed them,
neither in youreself, ne in youre conseillours, as yow oghte.	neither in yourself, nor in your advisors, as you ought.
Ye han erred also, for ye han shewed to youre conseillours	You have erred also, for you have shown to your advisors
youre talent and youre affeccioun to make werre anon and for to do vengeance.	your desire and your inclination to make war immediately and to do vengeance.
They han espied by youre wordes to what thyng ye been enclyned;	They have espied by your words to what thing you are inclined;
and therfore han they rather conseilled yow to youre talent than to youre profit.	and therefore have they advised you rather to your inclination than to your advantage.
Ye han erred also, for it semeth that yow suffiseth	You have erred also, for it seems that to you it suffices
to han been conseilled by thise conseillours oonly, and with litel avys,	to have been advised by these counselors only, and with little consultation,
whereas in so greet and so heigh a nede it hadde been necessarie mo conseillours	whereas in so great and so urgent a situation it had been necessary to have more advisors
and moore deliberacion to parfourne youre emprise.	and more deliberation to perform your undertaking.
Ye han erred also, for ye ne han nat examyned youre conseil in the forseyde manere,	You have erred also, for you have not examined your advice in the foresaid manner,
ne in due manere, as the caas requireth.	nor in suitable manner, as the case requires.
Ye han erred also, for ye han maked no division bitwixe youre conseillours -- this is to seyn,	You have erred also, for you have made no division between your advisors -- this is to say,
bitwixen youre trewe freendes and youre feyned conseillours --	between your true friends and your feigned advisors --
ne ye han nat knowe the wil of youre trewe freendes olde and wise,	and you have not known the will of your true friends old and wise,
but ye han cast alle hire wordes in an hochepot, and enclyned youre herte to the moore part	but you have cast all their words in an hodgepodge, and inclined your heart to the larger part
and to the gretter nombre, and there been ye condescended.	and to the greater number, and to that you are yielded.
And sith ye woot wel that men shal alwey fynde a gretter nombre of fooles than of wise men,	And since you know well that men shall always find a greater number of fools than of wise men,
and therfore the conseils that been at congregaciouns and multitudes of folk, there as men take moore reward	and therefore the counsels that are at gatherings and multitudes of folk, where men pay more attention
to the nombre than to the sapience of persones,	to the number than to the wisdom of persons,
ye se wel that in swiche conseillynges fooles han the maistrie."	you see well that in such councils fools have the mastery."
Melibeus answerde agayn, and seyde, "I graunte wel that I have erred;	Melibeus answered again, and said, "I grant well that I have erred;
but there as thou hast toold me heerbiforn	but whereas thou hast told me before now
that he nys nat to blame that chaungeth his conseillours in certein caas and for certeine juste causes,	that he is not to blame who changes his advisors in certain cases and for certain just causes,
I am al redy to chaunge my conseillours right as thow wolt devyse.	I am all ready to change my advisors just as thou will devise.
The proverbe seith that `for to do synne is mannyssh,	The proverb says that `to do sin is human,
but certes for to persevere longe in synne is werk of the devel.'"	but certainly to persevere long in sin is work of the devil.'"
To this sentence answered anon dame Prudence, and seyde,	To this sentence answered immediately dame Prudence, and said,
"Examineth," quod she, "youre conseil, and lat us see	"Examine," said she, "your counsel, and let us see
the whiche of hem han spoken most resonably and taught yow best conseil.	the which of them have spoken most reasonably and taught you best advice.
And for as muche as that the examynacion is necessarie, lat us bigynne at the surgiens	And forasmuch as the examination is necessary, let us begin at the surgeons
and at the phisiciens, that first speeken in this matiere.	and at the physicians, who first spoke in this matter.
I sey yow that the surgiens and phisiciens han seyd yow in youre conseil discreetly, as hem oughte,	I tell you that the surgeons and physicians have spoken to you in counselling you discretely, as they ought,
and in hir speche seyden ful wisely that to the office of hem aperteneth to doon to every wight	and in their speech said very wisely that to their office it pertains to do to every person
honour and profit, and no wight for to anoye,	honor and profit, and no person to harm,
and after hir craft to doon greet diligence	and in accordance with their craft to do great diligence
unto the cure of hem which that they han in hir governaunce.	unto the care of those that they have in their governance.
And, sire, right as they han answered wisely and discreetly,	And, sir, just as they have answered wisely and discretely,
right so rede I that they been heighly and sovereynly gerdoned for hir noble speche,	just so I deduce that they are highly and chiefly rewarded for their noble speech,
and eek for they sholde do the moore ententif bisynesse in the curacion of youre doghter deere.	and also for they should do the more diligent effort in the care of your dear daughter.
For al be it so that they been youre freendes, therfore shal ye nat suffren	For although it be so that they are your friends, therefore shall you not allow
that they serve yow for noght,	that they serve you for naught,
but ye oghte the rather gerdone hem and shewe hem youre largesse.	but you ought the rather to reward them and show them your generosity.
And as touchynge the proposicioun which that the phisiciens encreesceden in this caas -- this is to seyn,	And as touching the theory that the physicians developed in this case -- this is to say,
that in maladies that oon contrarie is warisshed by another contrarie --	that in maladies that one contrary is cured by another contrary --
I wolde fayn knowe hou ye understonde thilke text, and what is youre sentence."	I would be eager to know how you understand that text, and what is your interpretation."
"Certes," quod Melibeus, "I understonde it in this wise:	"Certainly," said Melibeus, "I understand it in this way:
that right as they han doon me a contrarie, right so sholde I doon hem another.	that just as they have done me a contrary, right so should I do them another.
For right as they han venged hem on me and doon me wrong,	For just as they have avenged themselves on me and done me wrong,
right so shal I venge me upon hem and doon hem wrong;	just so shall I avenge myself upon them and do them wrong;
and thanne have I cured oon contrarie by another."	and then have I cured one contrary by another."
"Lo, lo," quod dame Prudence, "how lightly is every man enclined to his owene desir	"Lo, lo," said dame Prudence, "how easily is every man inclined to his own desire
and to his owene plesaunce!	and to his own pleasure!
Certes," quod she, "the wordes of the phisiciens ne sholde nat han been understonden in thys wise.	Certainly," said she, "the words of the physicians should not have been understood in this way.
For certes, wikkednesse is nat contrarie to wikkednesse, ne vengeance to vengeaunce,	For certainly, wickedness is not contrary to wickedness, nor vengeance to vengeance,
ne wrong to wrong, but they been semblable.	nor wrong to wrong, but they are similar.
And therfore o vengeaunce is nat warisshed by another vengeaunce, ne o wroong by another wroong,	And therefore one vengeance is not cured by another vengeance, nor one wrong by another wrong,
but everich of hem encreesceth and aggreggeth oother.	but each of them increases and aggravates the other.
But certes, the wordes of the phisiciens sholde been understonden in this wise:	But certainly, the words of the physicians should be understood in this way:
for good and wikkednesse been two contraries, and pees and werre, vengeaunce	for good and wickedness are two contraries, and peace and war, vengeance
and suffraunce, discord and accord, and manye othere thynges;	and forbearance, discord and accord, and many other things ;
but certes, wikkednesse shal be warisshed by goodnesse, discord by accord, werre by pees,	but certainly, wickedness must be cured by goodness, discord by accord, war by peace,
and so forth of othere thynges.	and so forth of other things .
And heerto accordeth Seint Paul the Apostle in manye places.	And to this Saint Paul the Apostle agrees in many places.
He seith, `Ne yeldeth nat harm for harm, ne wikked speche for wikked speche,	He says, `Yield not harm for harm, nor wicked speech for wicked speech,
but do wel to hym that dooth thee harm and blesse hym that seith to thee harm.'	but do well to him that does thee harm and bless him that says to thee harm.'
And in manye othere places he amonesteth pees and accord.	And in many other places he recommends peace and accord.
But now wol I speke to yow of the conseil which that was yeven to yow	But now will I speak to you of the advice which was given to you
by the men of lawe and the wise folk,	by the men of law and the wise folk,
that seyden alle by oon accord, as ye han herd bifore,	who said all by unanimous agreement, as you have heard before,
that over alle thynges ye shal doon youre diligence to kepen youre persone and to warnestoore youre hous;	that over all things you shall do your best effort to guard your person and to garrison your house;
and seyden also that in this caas yow oghten for to werken ful avysely and with greet deliberacioun.	and said also that in this case you ought to work very advisedly and with great deliberation.
And, sire, as to the firste point, that toucheth to the kepyng of youre persone,	And, sir, as to the first point, that touches on the keeping of your person,
ye shul understonde that he that hath werre shal everemoore mekely and devoutly preyen, biforn alle thynges,	you shall understand that he who has war shall evermore meekly and devoutly pray, before all things,
that Jhesus Crist of his mercy wol han hym in his proteccion	that Jesus Christ of his mercy will have him in his protection
and been his sovereyn helpyng at his nede.	and be his best help at his need.
For certes, in this world ther is no wight that may be conseilled ne kept sufficeantly	For certainly, in this world there is no person that can be advised nor guarded sufficiently
withouten the kepyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist.	without the protection of our Lord Jesus Christ.
To this sentence accordeth the prophete David, that seith,	To this opinion agrees the prophet David, who says,
`If God ne kepe the citee, in ydel waketh he that it kepeth.'	`If God does not guard the city, in vain watches he who guards it.'
Now, sire, thanne shul ye committe the kepyng of youre persone	Now, sir, then shall you commit the guarding of your person
to youre trewe freendes that been approved and yknowe,	to your true friends that are proven and known,
and of hem shul ye axen help youre persone for to kepe. For Catoun seith,	and of them shall you ask help to guard your person. For Cato says,
`If thou hast nede of help, axe it of thy freendes,	`If thou hast need of help, ask it of thy friends,
for ther nys noon so good a phisicien as thy trewe freend.'	for there is no physician so good as thy true friend.'
And after this thanne shul ye kepe yow fro alle straunge folk, and fro lyeres,	And after this then shall you keep yourself from all unfamiliar folk, and from liars,
and have alwey in suspect hire compaignye.	and be always suspicious of their company.
For Piers Alfonce seith, `Ne taak no compaignye by the weye of a straunge man,	For Petrus Alphonsus says, `take no company by the way of a strange man,
but if so be that thou have knowe hym of a lenger tyme.	but if it so be that thou have known him of a longer time.
And if so be that he falle into thy compaignye paraventure, withouten thyn assent,	And if it so be that he fall into thy company by chance, without thine assent,
enquere thanne as subtilly as thou mayst of his conversacion, and of his lyf bifore, and feyne thy wey;	inquire then as subtly as thou can of his way of life, and of his life before, and feign thy way;
seye that [thou] wolt thider as thou wolt nat go;	say that [thou] wolt thither as thou will not go;
and if he bereth a spere, hoold thee on the right syde,	and if he bears a spear, hold thyself on the right side,
and if he bere a swerd, hoold thee on the lift syde.'	and if he bear a sword, hold thyself on the left side.'
And after this thanne shul ye kepe yow wisely from all swich manere peple as I have seyd bifore,	And after this then shall you keep yourself wisely from all such manner people as I have said before,
and hem and hir conseil eschewe.	and them and their advice shun.
And after this thanne shul ye kepe yow in swich manere	And after this then shall you keep yourself in such manner
that, for any presumpcion of youre strengthe, that ye ne dispise nat, ne accompte nat the myght	that, for any confidence in your strength, that you nor despise not, nor account not the might
of youre adversarie so litel that ye lete the kepyng of youre persone for youre presumpcioun,	of your adversary so little that you neglect the protection of your person because of your over-confidence,
for every wys man dredeth his enemy.	for every wise man dreads his enemy.
And Salomon seith, `Weleful is he that of alle hath drede,	And Solomon says, `Happy is he who of all has dread,
for certes, he that thurgh the hardynesse of his herte and thurgh the hardynesse of hymself hath	for certainly, he who through the hardiness of his heart and through the hardiness of himself has
to greet presumpcioun, hym shal yvel bityde.'	too great self-confidence, to him shall evil befall.'
Thanne shul ye everemoore contrewayte embusshementz and alle espiaille.	Then shall you evermore watch out for ambushes and all espionage,
For Senec seith that `the wise man that dredeth harmes, eschueth harmes,	For Seneca says that `the wise man who dreads harms, shuns harms,
ne he ne falleth into perils that perils eschueth.'	nor does he who shuns perils fall into perils.'
And al be it so that it seme that thou art in siker place,	And although it be so that it seems that thou art in a safe place,
yet shaltow alwey do thy diligence in kepynge of thy persone;	yet shalt thou always do thy best efforts in guarding of thy person;
this is to seyn, ne be nat necligent to kepe thy persone	this is to say, be not negligent to guard thy person
nat oonly fro thy gretteste enemys but fro thy leeste enemy.	not only from thy greatest enemies but from thy least enemy.
Senek seith, `A man that is well avysed, he dredeth his leste enemy.'	Seneca says, `A man that is well advised, he dreads his least enemy.'
Ovyde seith that `the litel wesele wol slee the grete bole and the wilde hert.'	Ovid says that `the little weasel will slay the great bull and the wild hart.'
And the book seith, `A litel thorn may prikke a kyng ful soore,	And the book says, `A little thorn may prick a king very sorely,
and an hound wol holde the wilde boor.'	and a hound will bring to bay the wild boar.'
But nathelees, I sey nat thou shalt be so coward that thou doute ther wher as is no drede.	But nevertheless, I say not thou should be so cowardly that thou fear where there is no reason for dread.
The book seith that `somme folk han greet lust to deceyve, but yet they dreden hem to be deceyved.'	The book says that `some folk have great desire to deceive, but yet they dread themselves to be deceived.'
Yet shaltou drede to been empoisoned and kepe the from the compaignye of scorneres.	Yet thou should dread to be poisoned and keep thyself from the company of scoffers.
For the book seith, `With scorneres make no compaignye, but flee hire wordes as venym.'	For the book says, `With scorners make no company, but flee their words as venom.'
"Now, as to the seconde point,	"Now, as to the second point,
where as youre wise conseillours conseilled yow to warnestoore youre hous with gret diligence,	whereas your wise advisors counseled you to fortify your house with great diligence,
I wolde fayn knowe how that ye understonde thilke wordes and what is youre sentence."	I would be eager to know how you understand those words and what is your decision."
Melibeus answerde and seyde, "Certes, I understande it in this wise: That I shal warnestoore myn hous with toures,	Melibeus answered and said, "Certainly, I understand it in this way: That I should fortify my house with towers,
swiche as han castelles and othere manere edifices, and armure, and artelries,	such as have castles and other sorts of edifices, and armor, and artillery,
by whiche thynges I may my persone and myn hous so kepen and deffenden	by which things I can my person and my house so guard and defend
that myne enemys shul been in drede myn hous for to approche."	that my enemies shall be in dread to approach my house."
To this sentence answerde anon Prudence: "Warnestooryng," quod she,	To this sentence answered immediately Prudence: "Fortifying," said she,
"of heighe toures and of grete edifices apperteyneth somtyme to pryde.	"of high towers and of great edifices pertains sometimes to pride.
And eek men make heighe toures, [and grete edifices] with grete costages and with greet travaille,	And also men make high towers, [and great edifices] with great expenditures and with great travail,
and whan that they been accompliced, yet be they nat worth a stree,	and when that they are accomplished, yet are they not worth a straw,
but if they be defended by trewe freendes that been olde and wise.	unless they are defended by true friends that are old and wise.
And understoond wel that the gretteste and strongeste garnysoun that a riche man may have,	And understand well that the greatest and strongest garrison that a rich man may have,
as wel to kepen his persone as his goodes, is	as well to keep his person as his goods, is
that he be biloved with hys subgetz and with his neighebores.	that he is beloved by his subjects and by his neighbors.
For thus seith Tullius, that `ther is a manere garnysoun	For thus says Cicero, that `there is a sort of garrison
that no man may venquysse ne disconfite, and that is	that no man can vanquish nor discomfit, and that is
a lord to be biloved of his citezeins and of his peple.'	for a lord to be beloved by his citizens and by his people.'
Now, sire, as to the thridde point, where as youre olde	Now, sir, as to the third point, whereas your old
and wise conseillours seyden that yow ne oghte nat sodeynly ne hastily proceden in this nede,	and wise advisors said that you ought not suddenly nor hastily proceed in this urgent matter,
but that yow oghte purveyen and apparaillen yow in this caas with greet diligence and greet deliberacioun;	but that you ought to prepare yourself and get ready in this case with great diligence and great deliberation;
trewely, I trowe that they seyden right wisely and right sooth.	truly, I believe that they spoke very wisely and real truth.
For Tullius seith, `In every nede, er thou bigynne it, apparaille thee with greet diligence.'	For Cicero says, `In every urgent matter, ere thou begin it, prepare thyself with great diligence.'
Thanne seye I that in vengeance-takyng, in werre, in bataille, and in warnestooryng,	Then say I that in vengeance-taking, in war, in battle, and in fortification,
er thow bigynne, I rede that thou apparaille thee therto, and do it with greet deliberacion.	ere thou begin, I advise that thou prepare thyself for that, and do it with great deliberation.
For Tullius seith that `longe apparaillyng biforn the bataille maketh short victorie.'	For Cicero says that `long preparation before the battle makes short victory.'
And Cassidorus seith, `The garnysoun is stronger whan it is longe tyme avysed.'	And Cassiodorus says, `The protection is stronger when it is long time considered.'
But now lat us speken of the conseil that was accorded by youre neighebores,	But now let us speak of the advice that was agreed upon by your neighbors,
swiche as doon yow reverence withouten love,	such as do you reverence without love,
youre olde enemys reconsiled, youre flatereres,	your old enemies reconciled, your flatterers,
that conseilled yow certeyne thynges prively, and openly conseilleden yow the contrarie;	that advised you certain things secretly, and openly counseled you the contrary;
the yonge folk also, that conseilleden yow to venge yow and make werre anon.	the young folk also, who advised you to avenge yourself and make war immediately.
And certes, sire, as I have seyd biforn, ye han greetly erred	And certainly, sir, as I have said before, you have greatly erred
to han cleped swich manere folk to youre conseil,	to have called such sort of folk to your council,
which conseillours been ynogh repreved by the resouns aforeseyd.	which advisors are enough reproved by the reasons spoken earlier.
But nathelees, lat us now descende to the special. Ye shuln first procede after the doctrine of Tullius.	But nevertheless, let us now descend to the particular details. You should first proceed according to the doctrine of Cicero.
Certes, the trouthe of this matiere, or of this conseil, nedeth nat diligently enquere,	Certainly, the truth of this matter, or of this advice, we need not diligently inquire,
for it is wel wist whiche they been that han doon to yow this trespas and vileynye,	for it is well known who they are that have done to you this trespass and villainy,
and how manye trespassours, and in what manere	and how many trespassers, and in what manner
they han to yow doon al this wrong and al this vileynye.	they have done to you all this wrong and all this villainy.
And after this, thanne shul ye examyne the seconde condicion which that the same Tullius addeth in this matiere.	And after this, then you should examine the second condition which the same Cicero adds in this matter.
For Tullius put a thyng which that he clepeth `consentynge'; this is to seyn,	For Cicero hypothesized a thing which he calls `consenting'; this is to say,
who been they, and whiche been they and how manye that consenten to thy conseil	who are they, and which are they and how many that consent to thy advice
in thy wilfulnesse to doon hastif vengeance.	in thy willfulness to do hasty vengeance.
And lat us considere also who been they, and how manye been they,	And let us consider also who are they, and how many are they,
and whiche been they that consenteden to youre adversaries.	and which are they that consented to your adversaries.
And certes, as to the firste poynt, it is wel knowen whiche folk been	And certainly, as to the first point, it is well known which folk are
they that consenteden to youre hastif wilfulnesse,	they that consented to your hasty willfulness,
for trewely, alle tho that conseilleden yow to maken sodeyn werre ne been nat youre freendes.	for truly, all those who advised you to make sudden war are not your friends.
Lat us now considere whiche been they that ye holde so greetly youre freendes as to youre persone.	Let us now consider which are they that you consider so greatly your friends as to your person.
For al be it so that ye be myghty and riche, certes ye ne been but allone,	For although it be so that you are mighty and rich, certainly you are but alone,
for certes ye ne han no child but a doghter,	for certainly you have no child but a daughter,
ne ye ne han bretheren, ne cosyns germayns, ne noon oother neigh kynrede,	nor do you have neither brethren, nor first cousins, nor any other close relatives,
wherfore that youre enemys for drede sholde stinte to plede with yow or to destroye youre persone.	for which your enemies for dread should stop pleading with you or destroying your person.
Ye knowen also that youre richesses mooten been dispended in diverse parties,	You know also that your riches must be dispended in several parts,
and whan that every wight hath his part, they ne wollen taken but litel reward to venge thy deeth.	and when each person has his part, they will take but little regard to avenging thy death.
But thyne enemys been thre, and they han manie children, bretheren, cosyns, and oother ny kynrede.	But thine enemies are three, and they have many children, brethren, cousins, and other close kin.
And though so were that thou haddest slayn of hem two or three, yet dwellen ther ynowe	And though it so were that thou haddest slain of them two or three, yet dwell there enough
to wreken hir deeth and to sle thy persone.	to avenge their death and to slay thy person.
And though so be that youre kynrede be moore siker and stedefast than the kyn of youre adversarie,	And though it so be that your kin are more sure and steadfast than the kin of your adversary,
yet nathelees youre kynrede nys but a fer kynrede; they been but litel syb to yow,	yet nevertheless your kinship is but a far kinship; they are but little related to you,
and the kyn of youre enemys been ny syb to hem.	and the kin of your enemies are close relatives to them.
And certes, as in that, hir condicioun is bet than youres.	And certainly, in that respect, their condition is better than yours.
Thanne lat us considere also if the conseillyng of hem that conseilleden yow to taken sodeyn vengeaunce,	Then let us consider also the advice of those who advised you to take sudden vengeance,
wheither it accorde to resoun.	whether it accord to reason.
And certes, ye knowe wel `nay.'	And certainly, you know well `nay.'
For, as by right and resoun, ther may no man taken vengeance on no wight	For, by justice and reason, there may no man take vengeance on no person
but the juge that hath the jurisdiccioun of it,	but the judge that has the jurisdiction of it,
whan it is graunted hym to take thilke vengeance hastily or attemprely, as the lawe requireth.	when it is granted to him to take that vengeance hastily or temperately, as the law requires.
And yet mooreover of thilke word that Tullius clepeth `consentynge,'	And yet moreover of that word that Cicero calls `consenting,'
thou shalt considere if thy myght and thy power may consenten	thou should consider if thy might and thy power can consent
and suffise to thy wilfulnesse and to thy conseillours.	and suffice to thy willfulness and to thy advisors.
And certes thou mayst wel seyn that `nay.'	And certainly thou can well say that `nay.'
For sikerly, as for to speke proprely, we may do no thyng	For truly, strictly speaking, we can do no thing
but oonly swich thyng as we may doon rightfully.	but only such thing as we can do justly.
And certes rightfully ne mowe ye take no vengeance, as of youre propre auctoritee.	And certainly in justice must you take no vengeance, as of your own authority.
Thanne mowe ye seen that youre power ne consenteth nat, ne accordeth nat, with youre wilfulnesse.	Then must you see that your power is not consistent, nor accords not, with your willfulness.
"Lat us now examyne the thridde point, which Tullius clepeth `consequent.'	"Let us now examine the third point, that Cicero calls `consequent.'
Thou shalt understonde that the vengeance that thou purposest for to take is the consequent;	Thou shalt understand that the vengeance that thou intendest to take is the consequent;
and therof folweth another vengeaunce, peril, and werre, and othere damages withoute nombre,	and thereof follows another vengeance, peril, and war, and other damages without number,
of whiche we be nat war, as at this tyme.	of which we are not aware, at this time.
And as touchynge the fourthe point, that Tullius clepeth `engendrynge,'	And as touching the fourth point, what Cicero calls `engendering,'
thou shalt considere that this wrong which that is doon to thee	thou shalt consider that this wrong which that is done to thee
is engendred of the hate of thyne enemys,	is engendered by the hate of thine enemies,
and of the vengeance-takynge upon that wolde engendre another vengeance,	and by the vengeance-taking thereupon that would engender another vengeance,
and muchel sorwe and wastynge of richesses, as I seyde.	and much sorrow and wasting of riches, as I said.
"Now, sire, as to the point that Tullius clepeth `causes,' which that is the laste point,	"Now, sir, as to the point that Cicero calls `causes,' which is the last point,
thou shalt understonde that the wrong that thou hast receyved hath certeine causes,	thou shalt understand that the wrong that thou hast received has certain causes,
whiche that clerkes clepen Oriens and Efficiens, and Causa longinqua and Causa propinqua;	which clerks call Oriens and Efficiens, and Causa longinqua and Causa propinqua;
this is to seyn, the fer cause and the ny cause.	this is to say, the far cause and the near cause.
The fer cause is almyghty God, that is cause of alle thynges.	The far cause is almighty God, that is cause of all things .
The neer cause is thy thre enemys.	The near cause is thy three enemies.
The cause accidental was hate.	The cause accidental was hate.
The cause material been the fyve woundes of thy doghter.	The cause material are the five wounds of thy daughter.
The cause formal is the manere of hir werkynge that broghten laddres and cloumben in at thy wyndowes.	The cause formal is the manner of their working who brought ladders and climbed in at thy windows.
The cause final was for to sle thy doghter. It letted nat in as muche as in hem was.	The cause final was to slay thy daughter. It did not delay insofar as was in their power.
But for to speken of the fer cause, as to what ende they shul come, or what shal finally	But to speak of the far cause, as to what end they shall come, or what shall finally
bityde of hem in this caas, ne kan I nat deeme but by conjectynge and by supposynge.	happen to them in this case, nor can I judge except by conjecture and by supposing.
For we shull suppose that they shul come to a wikked ende,	For we should suppose that they shall come to a wicked end,
by cause that the Book of Decrees seith, `Seelden, or with greet peyne, been causes ybroght to good ende	because the Book of Decrees says, `Seldom, or with great effort, are causes brought to a good end
whanne they been baddely bigonne.'	when they are badly begun.'
"Now, sire, if men wolde axe me why that God suffred men to do yow this vileynye,	"Now, sir, if men would ask me why God allowed men to do you this villainy,
certes, I kan nat wel answere, as for no soothfastnesse.	certainly, I can not well answer, with any certainty.
For th' apostle seith that `the sciences and the juggementz of oure Lord God almyghty been ful depe;	For the apostle says that `the sciences and the judgments of our Lord God almighty are very deep;
ther may no man comprehende ne serchen hem suffisantly.'	there can no man comprehend nor study them sufficiently.'
Nathelees, by certeyne presumpciouns and conjectynges, I holde and bileeve	Nonetheless, by certain assumptions and conjectures, I hold and believe
that God, which that is ful of justice and of rightwisnesse, hath suffred this bityde by juste cause resonable.	that God, who is full of justice and of righteousness, has allowed this to happen by just reasonable cause.
"Thy name is Melibee; this is to seyn, `a man that drynketh hony.'	"Thy name is Melibee; this is to say, `a man that drinks honey.'
Thou hast ydronke so muchel hony of sweete temporeel richesses, and delices and honours of this world	Thou hast drunk so much honey of sweet temporal riches, and pleasures and honors of this world
that thou art dronken and hast forgeten Jhesu Crist thy creatour.	that thou art drunk and hast forgotten Jesus Christ thy creator.
Thou ne hast nat doon to hym swich honour and reverence as thee oughte,	Thou hast not done to him such honor and reverence as thee ought,
ne thou ne hast nat wel ytaken kep to the wordes of Ovide, that seith,	nor thou hast not well paid attention to the words of Ovid, who says,
`Under the hony of the goodes of the body is hyd the venym that sleeth the soule.'	`Under the honey of the goods of the body is hid the venom that slays the soul.'
And Salomon seith, `If thou hast founden hony, ete of it that suffiseth,	And Solomon says, `If thou hast found honey, eat of it what suffices,
for if thou ete of it out of mesure, thou shalt spewe' and be nedy and povre.	for if thou eat of it to excess, thou shalt vomit' and be needy and poor.
And peraventure Crist hath thee in despit, and	And perhaps Christ has thee in disdain, and
hath turned awey fro thee his face and his eeris of misericorde,	has turned away from thee his face and his ears of mercy,
and also he hath suffred that thou hast been punysshed in the manere that thow hast ytrespassed.	and also he has allowed that thou hast been punished in the manner that thou hast trespassed.
Thou hast doon synne agayn oure Lord Crist,	Thou hast done sin again our Lord Christ,
for certes, the three enemys of mankynde	for certainly, the three enemies of mankind
-- that is to seyn, the flessh, the feend, and the world --	-- that is to say, the flesh, the fiend, and the world --
thou hast suffred hem entre in to thyn herte wilfully by the wyndowes of thy body,	thou hast allowed them enter into thine heart willfully by the windows of thy body,
and hast nat defended thyself suffisantly agayns hire assautes and hire temptaciouns,	and hast not defended thyself sufficiently against their assaults and their temptations,
so that they han wounded thy soule in fyve places;	so that they have wounded thy soul in five places;
this is to seyn, the deedly synnes that been entred into thyn herte by thy fyve wittes.	this is to say, the deadly sins that are entered into thine heart by thy five senses.
And in the same manere oure Lord Crist hath woold and suffred	And in the same manner our Lord Christ has willed and allowed
that thy three enemys been entred into thyn house by the wyndowes	that thy three enemies are entered into thine house by the windows
and han ywounded thy doghter in the forseyde manere."	and have wounded thy daughter in the aforesaid manner."
"Certes," quod Melibee, "I se wel that ye enforce yow muchel by wordes to overcome me in swich manere	"Certainly," said Melibee, "I see well that you strengthen yourself much by words to overcome me in such a manner
that I shal nat venge me of myne enemys,	that I shall not avenge me on my enemies,
shewynge me the perils and the yveles that myghten falle of this vengeance.	showing me the perils and the evils that might fall because of this vengeance.
But whoso wolde considere in alle vengeances the perils and yveles that myghte sewe of vengeance-takynge,	But if amyone would consider in all vengeances the perils and evils that might follow from vengeance-taking,
a man wolde nevere take vengeance, and that were harm;	a man would never take vengeance, and that would be a harm;
for by the vengeance-takynge been the wikked men dissevered fro the goode men,	for by the vengeance-taking are the wicked men distinguished from the good men,
and they that han wyl to do wikkednesse restreyne hir wikked purpos,	and they that have will to do wickedness restrain their wicked purpose,
whan they seen the punyssynge and chastisynge of the trespassours."	when they see the punishing and chastising of the trespassers."
And yet seye I moore, that right as a singuler persone synneth in takynge vengeance of another man,	And yet say I more, that just as a private person sins in taking vengeance on another man,
right so synneth the juge if he do no vengeance of hem that it han disserved.	just so sins the judge if he do no vengeance on them that have deserved it.
For Senec seith thus: `That maister,' he seith, `is good that proveth shrewes.'	For Seneca says thus: `That master,' he says, `is good who reproves scoundrels.'
And as Cassidore seith, `A man dredeth to do outrages whan he woot and knoweth	And as Cassiodorus says, `A man dreads to do outrages when he knows and is aware
that it displeseth to the juges and the sovereyns.'	that it displeases the judges and the rulers.'
And another seith, `The juge that dredeth to do right maketh men shrewes.'	And another says, `The judge that dreads to do justice makes men scoundrels.'
And Seint Paul the Apostle seith in his Epistle, whan he writeth unto the Romayns, that	And Saint Paul the Apostle says in his Epistle, when he writes unto the Romans, that
`the juges beren nat the spere withouten cause,	`the judges do not bear the spear without cause,
but they beren it to punysse the shrewes and mysdoers and for to defende the goode men.'	but they bear it to punish the scoundrels and evildoers and to defend the good men.'
If ye wol thanne take vengeance of youre enemys, ye shul retourne or have youre recours to the juge	If you will then take vengeance on your enemies, you shall turn to or bring your case to the judge
that hath the jurisdiccion upon hem,	that has the jurisdiction upon them,
and he shal punysse hem as the lawe axeth and requireth."	and he shall punish them as the law asks and requires."
"A," quod Melibee, "this vengeance liketh me no thyng.	"A," said Melibee, "this vengeance pleases me not at all.
I bithenke me now and take heede how Fortune hath norissed me fro my childhede	I consider now and take heed how Fortune has nourished me from my childhood
and hath holpen me to passe many a stroong paas.	and has helped me to pass many a difficult situation.
Now wol I assayen hire, trowynge, with Goddes help, that she shal helpe me my shame for to venge."	Now will I test her, believing that, with God's help, she shall help me to avenge my shame."
"Certes," quod Prudence, "if ye wol werke by my conseil, ye shul nat assaye Fortune by no wey,	"Certainly," said Prudence, "if you will work by my advice, you shall not test Fortune in any way,
ne ye shul nat lene or bowe unto hire, after the word of Senec,	nor shall you rely on or bow unto her, according to the word of Seneca,
for `thynges that been folily doon, and that been in hope of Fortune, shullen nevere come to good ende.'	for `things that are foolishly done, and that are in hope of Fortune, shall never come to a good end.'
And, as the same Senec seith, `The moore cleer and the moore shynyng that Fortune is,	And, as the same Seneca says, `The more clear and the more shining that Fortune is,
the moore brotil and the sonner broken she is.'	the more brittle and the sooner broken she is.'
Trusteth nat in hire, for she nys nat stidefast ne stable,	Trust not in her, for she is not steadfast nor stable,
for whan thow trowest to be moost seur or siker of hire help,	for when thou believest her to be most sure or certain of her help,
she wol faille thee and deceyve thee.	she will fail thee and deceive thee.
And where as ye seyn that Fortune hath norissed yow fro youre childhede,	And whereas you say that Fortune has nourished you from your childhood,
I seye that in so muchel shul ye the lasse truste in hire and in hir wit.	I say that to that degree should you have the less trust in her and in her wisdom.
For Senec seith, `What man that is norissed by Fortune, she maketh hym a greet fool.'	For Seneca says, `Whatever man that is nourished by Fortune, she makes him a great fool.'
Now thanne, syn ye desire and axe vengeance, and the vengeance that is doon after the lawe	Now then, since you desire and ask vengeance, and the vengeance that is done according to the law
and bifore the juge ne liketh yow nat,	and before the judge pleases you not,
and the vengeance that is doon in hope of Fortune is perilous and uncertein,	and the vengeance that is done in hope of Fortune is perilous and uncertain,
thanne have ye noon oother remedie but for to have youre recours	then have you no other remedy but to have your recourse
unto the sovereyn Juge that vengeth alle vileynyes and wronges.	unto the Supreme Judge that avenges all villainies and wrongs.
And he shal venge yow after that hymself witnesseth, where as he seith,	And he shall avenge you according to what he himself witnesses, where he says,
`Leveth the vengeance to me, and I shal do it.'"	`Leave the vengeance to me, and I shall do it.'"
Melibee answerde, "If I ne venge me nat of the vileynye that men han doon to me,	Melibee answered, "If I do not avenge myself for the villainy that men have done to me,
I sompne or warne hem that han doon to me that vileynye,	I summon or announce to them that have done to me that villainy,
and alle othere, to do me another vileynye.	and all others, to do me another villainy.
For it is writen, `If thou take no vengeance of an oold vileynye,	For it is written, `If thou take no vengeance of an old villainy,
thou sompnest thyne adversaries to do thee a newe vileynye.'	thou summonest thine adversaries to do thee a new villainy.'
And also for my suffrance men wolden do me so muchel vileynye that	And also for my patience men would do to me so much villainy that
I myghte neither bere it ne susteene,	I might neither bear nor sustain it,
and so sholde I been put and holden overlowe.	and so should I be put down and considered too humble.
For men seyn, `In muchel suffrynge shul manye thynges falle unto thee whiche thou shalt nat mowe suffre.'"	For men say, `In much suffering shall many things happen to thee which thou shalt not be able to endure.'"
"Certes," quod Prudence, "I graunte yow that over-muchel suffraunce is nat good.	"Certainly," said Prudence, "I grant you that over-much patience is not good.
But yet ne folweth it nat therof that every persone to whom men doon vileynye take of it vengeance,	But yet it follows not thereof that every person to whom men do villainy should take vengeance for it,
for that aperteneth and longeth al oonly to the juges, for they shul venge the vileynyes and injuries.	for that pertains and belongs entirely only to the judges, for they shall avenge the villainies and injuries.
And therfore tho two auctoritees that ye han seyd above been oonly understonden in the juges,	And therefore those two authorities that you have spoken of above are only understood in the judges,
for whan they suffren over-muchel the wronges and the vileynyes to be doon withouten punysshynge,	for when they allow over-much the wrongs and the villainies to be done without punishing,
they sompne nat a man al oonly for to do newe wronges, but they comanden it.	they summon a man not entirely only to do new wrongs, but they command it.
Also a wys man seith that `the juge that correcteth nat the synnere comandeth and biddeth hym do synne.'	Also a wise man says that `the judge who corrects not the sinner commands and bids him to do sin.'
And the juges and sovereyns myghten in hir land so muchel suffre of the shrewes and mysdoeres	And the judges and rulers might in their land so much tolerate the scoundrels and evildoers
that they sholden, by swich suffrance, by proces of tyme wexen of swich power and myght	that they should, because of such tolerance, by the passage of time grow in such power and might
that they sholden putte out the juges and the sovereyns from hir places,	that they should put out the judges and the rulers from their places,
and atte laste maken hem lesen hire lordshipes.	and at the last make them lose their lordships.
"But lat us now putte that ye have leve to venge yow.	"But let us now suppose that you have leave to avenge yourself.
I seye ye been nat of myght and power as now to venge yow,	I say you are not of might and power right now to avenge yourself,
for if ye wole maken comparisoun unto the myght of youre adversaries, ye shul fynde in manye thynges that	for if you will make comparison unto the might of your adversaries, you shall find in many things that
I have shewed yow er this that hire condicion is bettre than youres.	I have showed you ere this that their condition is better than yours.
And therfore seye I that it is good as now that ye suffre and be pacient.	And therefore say I that it is good for now that you suffer and be patient.
"Forthermoore, ye knowen wel that after the comune sawe, `it is a woodnesse a man to stryve	"Furthermore, you know well that according to the common saying, `it is a madness for a man to strive
with a strenger or a moore myghty man than he is hymself,	with a stronger or a more mighty man than he is himself,
and for to stryve with a man of evene strengthe -- that is to seyn,	and to strive with a man of even strength -- that is to say,
with as strong a man as he is -- it is peril,	with as strong a man as he is -- it is perilous/ ,
and for to stryve with a weyker man, it is folie.'	and to strive with a weaker man, it is folly.'
And therfore sholde a man flee stryvynge as muchel as he myghte.	And therefore a man should flee striving as much as he might.
For Salomon seith, `It is a greet worshipe to a man to kepen hym fro noyse and stryf.'	For Solomon says, `It is a great honor to a man to keep himself from quarrels and strife.'
And if it so bifalle or happe that a man of gretter myght and strengthe	And if it so befall or happen that a man of greater might and strength
than thou art do thee grevaunce,	than thou art do thee grievance,
studie and bisye thee rather to stille the same grevaunce than for to venge thee.	take pains and busy thyself rather to still the same grievance than to avenge thyself.
For Senec seith that `he putteth hym in greet peril	For Seneca says that `he puts himself in great peril
that stryveth with a gretter man than he is hymself.'	that strives with a greater man than he is himself.'
And Catoun seith, `If a man of hyer estaat or degree, or moore myghty than thou,	And Cato says, `If a man of higher estate or degree, or more mighty than thou,
do thee anoy or grevaunce, suffre hym,	do thee annoyance or grievance, endure it,
for he that oones hath greved thee, may another tyme releeve thee and helpe.'	for he that once has grieved thee, may another time relieve thee and help.'
Yet sette I caas ye have bothe myght and licence for to venge yow,	Yet I assume (for the sake of argument) you have both might and permission to avenge yourself,
I seye that ther be ful manye thynges that shul restreyne yow of vengeance-takynge	I say that there are very many things that should restrain you from vengeance-taking
and make yow for to enclyne to suffre, and for to han pacience	and make you to incline to suffer, and to have patience
in the wronges that han been doon to yow.	in the wrongs that have been done to you.
First and foreward, if ye wole considere the defautes that been in youre owene persone,	First of all, if you will consider the faults that are in your own person,
for whiche defautes God hath suffred yow have this tribulacioun, as I have seyd yow heer-biforn.	for which faults God has allowed you to have this tribulation, as I have said to you before.
For the poete seith that `we oghte paciently taken the tribulacions	For the poet says that `we ought patiently to take the tribulations
that comen to us, whan we thynken and consideren that we han disserved to have hem.'	that come to us, when we think and consider that we have deserved to have them.'
And Seint Gregorie seith that `whan a man considereth wel the nombre of his defautes and of his synnes,	And Saint Gregory says that `when a man considers well the number of his faults and of his sins,
the peynes and the tribulaciouns that he suffreth semen the lesse unto hym;	the pains and the tribulations that he suffers seem the less unto him;
and in as muche as hym thynketh his synnes moore hevy and grevous,	and inasmuch as he thinks his sins more heavy and grievous,
in so muche semeth his peyne the lighter and the esier unto hym.'	insomuch seems his pain the lighter and the easier unto him.'
Also ye owen to enclyne and bowe youre herte	Also you ought to incline and bow your heart
to take the pacience of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, as seith Seint Peter in his Epistles.	to adopt the patience of our Lord Jesus Christ, as says Saint Peter in his Epistles.
`Jhesu Crist,' he seith, `hath suffred for us and yeven ensample to every man to folwe and sewe hym,	`Jesus Christ,' he says, `has suffered for us and given example to every man to follow and be guided by him,
for he dide nevere synne, ne nevere cam ther a vileyns word out of his mouth.	for he did never sin, nor never came there a villainous word out of his mouth.
Whan men cursed hym, he cursed hem noght, and whan men betten hym, he manaced hem noght.'	When men cursed him, he cursed them not, and when men beat him, he menaced them not.'
Also the grete pacience which the seintes that been in Paradys han had in tribulaciouns	Also the great patience which the saints that are in Paradise have had in tribulations
that they han ysuffred, withouten hir desert or gilt,	that they have suffered, without their deserts or guilt,
oghte muchel stiren yow to pacience.	ought much stir you to patience.
Forthermoore ye sholde enforce yow to have pacience,	Furthermore you should force yourself to have patience,
considerynge that the tribulaciouns of this world but litel while endure and soone passed been and goon,	considering that the tribulations of this world but little while endure and soon are passed and gone,
and the joye that a man seketh to have by pacience in tribulaciouns is perdurable,	and the joy that a man seeks to have by patience in tribulations is ever-lasting,
after that the Apostle seith in his epistle.	according to what the Apostle says in his epistle.
`The joye of God,' he seith, `is perdurable' -- that is to seyn, everelastynge.	`The joy of God,' he says, `is perdurable' -- that is to say, everlasting.
Also troweth and bileveth stedefastly that he nys nat wel ynorissed, ne wel ytaught,	Also think and believe steadfastly that he is not well trained, nor well taught,
that kan nat have pacience or wol nat receyve pacience.	who can not have patience or will not receive patience.
For Salomon seith that `the doctrine and the wit of a man is knowen by pacience.'	For Solomon says that `the doctrine and the wit of a man is known by patience.'
And in another place he seith that `he that is pacient governeth hym by greet prudence.'	And in another place he says that `he that is patient governs himself with great prudence.'
And the same Salomon seith, `The angry and wrathful man maketh noyses,	And the same Solomon says, `The angry and wrathful man makes quarrels,
and the pacient man atempreth hem and stilleth.'	and the patient man moderates and stills them.'
He seith also, `It is moore worth to be pacient than for to be right strong;	He says also, `It is more worthy to be patient than to be very strong;
and he that may have the lordshipe of his owene herte is moore to preyse than he that	and he that may have the lordship of his own heart is more to be praised than he that
by his force or strengthe taketh grete citees.'	by his force or strength takes great cities.'
And therfore seith Seint Jame in his Epistle that `pacience is a greet vertu of perfeccioun.'"	And therefore says Saint James in his Epistle that `patience is a great virtue of perfection.'"
"Certes," quod Melibee, "I graunte yow, dame Prudence, that pacience is a greet vertu of perfeccioun;	"Certainly," said Melibee, "I grant you, dame Prudence, that patience is a great virtue of perfection;
but every man may nat have the perfeccioun that ye seken;	but every man may not have the perfection that you seek;
ne I nam nat of the nombre of right parfite men,	nor am I of the number of very perfect men,
for myn herte may nevere been in pees unto the tyme it be venged.	for my heart may never be in peace until the time it is avenged.
And al be it so that it was greet peril to myne enemys	And although it be so that it was great peril to my enemies
to do me a vileynye in takynge vengeance upon me,	to do me a villainy in taking vengeance upon me,
yet tooken they noon heede of the peril, but fulfilleden hir wikked wyl and hir corage.	yet took they no heed of the peril, but fulfilled their wicked will and their desire.
And therfore me thynketh men oghten nat repreve me,	And therefore it seems to me men ought not reprove me,
though I putte me in a litel peril for to venge me,	though I put myself in a little peril in order to avenge myself,
and though I do a greet excesse; that is to seyn, that I venge oon outrage by another."	and though I do a great excess; that is to say, that I avenge one outrage by another."
"A," quod dame Prudence, "ye seyn youre wyl and as yow liketh,	"A," said dame Prudence, "you say your will and as you please,
but in no caas of the world a man sholde nat doon outrage ne excesse for to vengen hym.	but in no case of the world should a man do outrage nor excess to avenge himself.
For Cassidore seith that `as yvele dooth he that vengeth hym by outrage as he that dooth the outrage.'	For Cassiodorus says that `as evil does he that avenges himself by outrage as he that does the outrage.'
And therfore ye shul venge yow after the ordre of right; that is to seyn, by the lawe	And therefore you shall avenge yourself after the order of justice; that is to say, by the law
and noght by excesse ne by outrage.	and not by excess nor by outrage.
And also, if ye wol venge yow of the outrage of youre adversaries	And also, if you will avenge yourself of the outrage of your adversaries
in oother manere than right comandeth, ye synnen.	in other manner than justice commands, you sin.
And therfore seith Senec that `a man shal nevere vengen shrewednesse by shrewednesse.'	And therefore says Seneca that `a man shall never avenge wickedness by wickedness."
And if ye seye that right axeth a man to defenden violence by violence and fightyng by fightyng,	And if you say that justice asks a man to fight off violence by violence and fighting by fighting,
certes ye seye sooth, whan the defense is doon anon withouten intervalle or withouten tariyng or delay,	certainly you say truth, when the defense is done immediately without interval or without tarrying or delay,
for to deffenden hym and nat for to vengen hym.	to defend himself and not to avenge himself.
And it bihoveth that a man putte swich attemperance in his deffense	And it is fitting that a man put so much temperance in his defense
that men have no cause ne matiere to repreven hym that deffendeth hym of excesse and outrage,	that men have no cause nor matter to reprove him that defends himself from excess and outrage,
for ellis were it agayn resoun.	for otherwise it would be against reason.
Pardee, ye knowen wel that ye maken no deffense	By God, you know well that you make no defense
as now for to deffende yow, but for to venge yow;	right now to defend yourself, but to avenge yourself;
and so seweth it that ye han no wyl to do youre dede attemprely.	and so it follows that you have no will to do your deed temperately.
And therfore me thynketh that pacience is good. For Salomon seith that	And therefore it seems to me that patience is good. For Solomon says that
`he that is nat pacient shal have greet harm.'"	`he that is not patient shall have great harm.'"
"Certes," quod Melibee, "I graunte yow that whan a man is inpacient and wrooth of that	"Certainly," said Melibee, "I grant you that when a man is impatient and angry with that
that toucheth hym noght and that aperteneth nat unto hym, though it harme hym, it is no wonder.	which touches him not and which pertains not unto him, though it harm him, it is no wonder.
For the lawe seith that `he is coupable that entremetteth hym	For the law says that `he is guilty that intrudes himself
or medleth with swych thyng as aperteneth nat unto hym.'	or meddles with such thing as pertains not unto him.'
And Salomon seith that `he that entremetteth hym of the noyse or strif of another man	And Solomon says that `he that meddles with the quarrels or strife of another man
is lyk to hym that taketh an hound by the eris.'	is like to him that takes an hound by the ears.'
For right as he that taketh a straunge hound by the eris is outherwhile biten with the hound,	For just as he that takes a strange hound by the ears is at another time bitten by the hound,
right in the same wise is it resoun that he have harm that by his inpacience medleth hym	in just the same way it is reasonable that he have harm who by his impatience meddles himself
of the noyse of another man, wheras it aperteneth nat unto hym.	with the quarrels of another man, whereas it pertains not unto him.
But ye knowen wel that this dede -- that is to seyn,	But you know well that this deed -- that is to say,
my grief and my disese -- toucheth me right ny.	my grief and my suffering -- touches me very closely.
And therfore, though I be wrooth and inpacient, it is no merveille.	And therefore, though I am angry and impatient, it is no marvel.
And, savynge youre grace, I kan nat seen that it myghte greetly harme me though I tooke vengeaunce.	And, with all due respect to you, I can not see that it might greatly harm me though I took vengeance.
For I am richer and moore myghty than myne enemys been;	For I am richer and more mighty than my enemies are;
and wel knowen ye that by moneye and by havynge grete possessions	and you well know that by money and by having great possessions
been alle the thynges of this world governed.	are all the things of this world governed.
And Salomon seith that `alle thynges obeyen to moneye.'"	And Solomon says that `all things obey to money.'"
Whan Prudence hadde herd hir housbonde avanten hym of his richesse	When Prudence had heard her husband boast of his riches
and of his moneye, dispreisynge the power of his adversaries,	and of his money, belittling the power of his adversaries,
she spak and seyde in this wise:	she spoke and said in this manner:
"Certes, deere sire, I graunte yow that ye been riche and myghty	"Certainly, dear sir, I grant you that you are rich and mighty
and that the richesses been goode to hem that han wel ygeten hem and wel konne usen hem.	and that riches are good to those that have well gotten them and well know how to use them.
For right as the body of a man may nat lyven withoute the soule,	For just as the body of a man can not live without the soul,
namoore may it lyve withouten temporeel goodes.	no more than it can live without temporal goods.
And by richesses may a man gete hym grete freendes.	And by riches a man get can himself great friends.
And therfore seith Pamphilles: `If a net-herdes doghter,' seith he, `be riche,	And therefore says Pamphilles: `If a cowherd's daughter,' says he, `is rich,
she may chesen of a thousand men which she wol take to hir housbonde,	she may choose of a thousand men which she will take to her husband,
for, of a thousand men, oon wol nat forsaken hire ne refusen hire.'	for, of a thousand men, not one will forsake her nor refuse her.'
And this Pamphilles seith also, `If thow be right happy -- that is to seyn,	And this Pamphilles says also, `If thou be very happy -- that is to say,
if thou be right riche -- thou shalt fynde a greet nombre of felawes and freendes.	if thou be very rich -- thou shalt find a great number of fellows and friends.
And if thy fortune change that thou wexe povre, farewel freendshipe and felaweshipe,	And if thy fortune change that thou wax poor, farewell friendship and fellowship,
for thou shalt be alloone withouten any compaignye, but if it be the compaignye of povre folk.'	for thou shalt be alone without any company, except if it be the company of poor folk.'
And yet seith this Pamphilles moreover that `they that been thralle and bonde of lynage	And yet says this Pamphilles moreover that `they that are enslaved and in bondage by birth
shullen been maad worthy and noble by the richesses.'	shall be made worthy and noble by riches.'
And right so as by richesses ther comen manye goodes,	And just as by riches there come many goods,
right so by poverte come ther manye harmes and yveles,	just so by poverty come there many harms and evils,
for greet poverte constreyneth a man to do manye yveles.	for great poverty constrains a man to do many evils.
And therfore clepeth Cassidore poverte the mooder of ruyne;	And therefore Cassiodorus calls poverty the mother of ruin;
that is to seyn, the mooder of overthrowynge or fallynge doun.	that is to say, the mother of overthrowing or falling down.
And therfore seith Piers Alfonce, `Oon of the gretteste adversitees of this world is	And therefore says Petrus Alphonsus, `One of the greatest adversities of this world is
whan a free man by kynde or of burthe is constreyned by poverte	when a man free by nature or by birth is constrained by poverty
to eten the almesse of his enemy,'	to eat the alms of his enemy,'
and the same seith Innocent in oon of his bookes. He seith that	and the same says Innocent in one of his books. He says that
`sorweful and myshappy is the condicioun of a povre beggere;	`sorrowful and unfortunate is the condition of a poor beggar;
for if he axe nat his mete, he dyeth for hunger;	for if he does not beg for his food, he dies for hunger;
and if he axe, he dyeth for shame; and algates necessitee constreyneth hym to axe.'	and if be begs, he dies for shame, and yet necessity constrains him to beg.'
And seith Salomon that `bet it is to dye than for to have swich poverte.'	And says Solomon that `better it is to die than to have such poverty.'
And as the same Salomon seith, `Bettre it is to dye of bitter deeth	And as the same Solomon says, `Better it is to die of bitter death
than for to lyven in swich wise.'	than to live in such a way.'
By thise resons that I have seid unto yow and by manye othere resons that I koude seye,	By these reasons that I have said unto you and by many other reasons that I could say,
I graunte yow that richesses been goode to hem that geten hem wel	I grant you that riches are good to them that get them well
and to hem that wel usen tho richesses.	and to them that well use those riches.
And therfore wol I shewe yow hou ye shul have yow, and how ye shul bere yow	And therefore will I show you how you should behave, and how you should bear yourself
in gaderynge of richesses, and in what manere ye shul usen hem.	in gathering of riches, and in what manner you shall use them.
"First, ye shul geten hem withouten greet desir, by good leyser, sokyngly and nat over-hastily.	"First, you shall get them without great desire, by good deliberation, slowly and not over-hastily.
For a man that is to desirynge to gete richesses abaundoneth hym	For a man that is too desiring to get riches devotes himself
first to thefte, and to alle othere yveles;	first to theft, and to all other evils;
and therfore seith Salomon, `He that hasteth hym to bisily to wexe riche shal be noon innocent.'	and therefore says Solomon, `He that hastens him too busily to wax rich shall be no innocent.'
He seith also that `the richesse that hastily cometh to a man soone	He says also that `the riches that hastily come to a man soon
and lightly gooth and passeth fro a man,	and easily go and pass from a man,
but that richesse that cometh litel and litel wexeth alwey and multiplieth.'	but those riches that come little by little always grow and multiply.'
And, sire, ye shul geten richesses by youre wit and by youre travaille unto youre profit,	And, sir, you shall get riches by your wit and by your travail unto your advantage,
and that withouten wrong or harm doynge to any oother persone.	and that without doing wrong or harm to any other person.
For the lawe seith that `ther maketh no man himselven riche, if he do harm to another wight.'	For the law says that `there makes no man himself rich, if he does harm to another person.'
This is to seyn, that nature deffendeth and forbedeth by right that	This is to say, that nature prohibits and forbids justly that
no man make hymself riche unto the harm of another persone.	any man make himself rich unto the harm of another person.
And Tullius seith that `no sorwe, ne no drede of deeth, ne no thyng	And Cicero says that `no sorrow, nor no dread of death, nor no thing
that may falle unto a man, is so muchel agayns	that may happen to a man, is so much against
nature as a man to encressen his owene profit to the harm of another man.	nature as for a man to increase his own advantage to the harm of another man.
And though the grete men and the myghty men geten richesses moore lightly than thou,	And though the great men and the mighty men get riches more easily than thou,
yet shaltou nat been ydel ne slow to do thy profit, for thou shalt in alle wise flee ydelnesse.'	yet thou shalt not be idle nor slow to do thy benefit, for thou shalt in all ways flee idleness.'
For Salomon seith that `ydelnesse techeth a man to do manye yveles.'	For Solomon says that `idleness teaches a man to do many evils.'
And the same Salomon seith that `he that travailleth and bisieth hym to tilien his land shal eten breed,	And the same Solomon says that `he that works and busies himself to till his land shall eat bread,
but he that is ydel and casteth hym to no bisynesse	but he that is idle and devotes himself to no business
ne occupacioun shal falle into poverte and dye for hunger.'	nor occupation shall fall into poverty and die for hunger.'
And he that is ydel and slow kan nevere fynde covenable tyme for to doon his profit.	And he that is idle and slow can never find suitable time to earn his profit.
For ther is a versifiour who seith that `the ydel man excuseth hym in wynter by cause	For there is a versifier says that `the idle man excuses himself in winter because
of the grete coold, and in somer by enchesoun of the greete heete.'	of the great cold, and in summer by reason of the great heat.'
For thise causes seith Caton, `Waketh and enclyneth nat yow over-muchel for to slepe,	For these causes says Cato, `Wake and incline you not over-much to sleep,
for over-muchel reste norisseth and causeth manye vices.'	for over-much rest nourishes and causes many vices.'
And therfore seith Seint Jerome, `Dooth somme goode dedes that the devel,	And therefore says Saint Jerome, `Do some good deeds that the devil,
who is oure enemy, ne fynde yow nat unocupied.'	which is our enemy, not find you unoccupied.'
For the devel ne taketh nat lightly unto his werkynge swiche as he fyndeth occupied in goode werkes.	For the devil takes not easily unto his power such as he finds occupied in good works.
"Thanne thus in getynge richesses ye mosten flee ydelnesse.	"Then thus in getting riches you must flee idleness.
And afterward, ye shul use the richesses which ye have geten by youre wit and by youre travaille	And afterward, you must use the riches which you have gotten by your wit and by your labor
in swich a manere that men holde yow nat to scars, ne to sparynge, ne to fool-large	in such a manner that men consider you not too niggardly, nor too frugal, nor too foolishly generous
-- that is to seyen, over-large a spendere.	-- that is to say, over-generous a spender.
For right as men blamen an avaricious man by cause of his scarsetee and chyncherie,	For just as men blame an avaricious man because of his niggardliness and miserliness,
in the same wise is he to blame that spendeth over-largely.	in the same way is he to blame that spends over-generously.
And therfore seith Caton: `Use,' he seith, `thy richesses that thou hast geten	And therefore says Cato: `Use,' he says, `thy riches that thou hast gotten
in swich a manere that men have no matiere ne cause to calle thee neither wrecche ne chynche,	in such a manner that men have no reason nor cause to call thee neither wretch nor miser,
for it is a greet shame to a man to have a povere herte and a riche purs.'	for it is a great shame to a man to have a poor heart and a rich purse.'
He seith also, `The goodes that thou hast ygeten, use hem by mesure;'	He says also, `The goods that thou hast gotten, use them by measure;'
that is to seyn, spende hem mesurably,	that is to say, spend them moderately,
for they that folily wasten and despenden the goodes that they han,	for they who foolishly waste and squander the goods that they have,
whan they han namoore propre of hir owene, they shapen hem to take the goodes of another man.	when they have no more property of their own, they devote themselves to taking the goods of another man.
I seye thanne that ye shul fleen avarice,	I say then that you must flee avarice,
usynge youre richesses in swich manere that men seye nat that youre richesses been yburyed	using your riches in such a manner that men say not that your riches are buried
but that ye have hem in youre myght and in youre weeldynge.	but that you have them in your power and in your control.
For a wys man repreveth the avaricious man, and seith thus in two vers:	For a wise man reproves the avaricious man, and says thus in two verses:
`Wherto and why burieth a man his goodes by his grete avarice,	`For what reason and why buries a man his goods by his great avarice,
and knoweth wel that nedes moste he dye?	and he knows well that by necessity he must die?
For deeth is the ende of every man as in this present lyf.'	For death is the end of every man in this present life.'
And for what cause or enchesoun joyneth he hym or knytteth he hym so faste unto his goodes	And for what cause or reason he joins himself or he knits himself so fast unto his goods
that alle hise wittes mowen nat disseveren hym or departen hym from his goodes,	that all his wits can not separate him or depart him from his goods,
and knoweth wel, or oghte knowe, that whan he is deed	and knows well, or ought know, that when he is dead
he shal no thyng bere with hym out of this world?	he shall nothing bear with him out of this world?
And therfore seith Seint Austyn that `the avaricious man is likned unto helle,	And therefore says Saint Austin that `the avaricious man is likened unto hell,
that the moore it swelweth the moore desir it hath to swelwe and devoure.'	that the more it swallows the more desire it has to swallow and devour.'
And as wel as ye wolde eschewe to be called an avaricious man or chynche,	And as well as you would shun to be called an avaricious man or miser,
as wel sholde ye kepe yow and governe yow in swich a wise who men calle yow nat fool-large.	as well should you keep yourself and govern yourself in such a way that men do not call you foolishly generous.
Therfore seith Tullius: `The goodes,' he seith, `of thyn hous ne sholde nat been hyd ne kept so cloos,	Therefore says Cicero: `The goods,' he says, `of thine house should not be hidden nor kept so close,
but that they myghte been opened by pitee and debonairetee'	but that they might not be opened by pity and graciousness'
(that is to seyn, to yeven part to hem that han greet nede),	(that is to say, to give part to them that have great need),
`ne thy goodes shullen nat been so opene to been every mannes goodes.'	`Nor thy goods must not be so open to be every man's goods.'
Afterward, in getynge of youre richesses and in usynge hem ye shul alwey have thre thynges in youre herte	Afterward, in getting of your riches and in using them you must always have three things in your heart
(that is to seyn, oure Lord God, conscience, and good name).	(that is to say, our Lord God, conscience, and good name).
First, ye shul have God in youre herte,	First, you shall have God in your heart,
and for no richesse ye shullen do no thyng which may in any manere displese God,	and for no riches you shall do any thing which may in any manner displease God,
that is youre creatour and makere.	that is your creator and maker.
For after the word of Salomon, `It is bettre to have a litel good with the love of God	For after the word of Solomon, `It is better to have a little good with the love of God
than to have muchel good and tresour and lese the love of his Lord God.'	than to have much good and treasure and lose the love of his Lord God.'
And the prophete seith that `bettre it is to been a good man and have litel good and tresour	And the prophet says that `better it is to be a good man and have little good and treasure
than to been holden a shrewe and have grete richesses.'	than to be held a scoundrel and have great riches.'
And yet seye I ferthermoore, that ye sholde alwey doon youre bisynesse to gete yow richesses,	And yet say I furthermore, that you should always do your business to get yourself riches,
so that ye gete hem with good conscience.	providing that you get them with good conscience.
And th' Apostle seith that `ther nys thyng in this world of which	And the Apostle says that `there is nothing in this world of which
we sholden have so greet joye as whan oure conscience bereth us good witnesse.'	we should have so great joy as when our conscience bears us good witness.'
And the wise man seith, `The substance of a man is ful good,	And the wise man says, `The substance of a man is very good,
whan synne is nat in mannes conscience.'	when sin is not in man's conscience.'
Afterward, in getynge of youre richesses and in usynge of hem,	Afterward, in getting of your riches and in using of them,
yow moste have greet bisynesse and greet diligence that youre goode name be alwey kept and conserved.	you must have great effort and greet diligence that your good name be always kept and conserved.
For Salomon seith that `bettre it is and moore it availleth a man to have a good name	For Solomon says that `better it is and more it avails a man to have a good name
than for to have grete richesses.'	than to have great riches.'
And therfore he seith in another place, `Do greet diligence,' seith Salomon,	And therefore he says in another place, `Do great diligence,' says Solomon,
`in kepyng of thy freend and of thy goode name;	`in keeping of thy friend and of thy good name;
for it shal lenger abide with thee than any tresour, be it never so precious.'	for it shall longer abide with thee than any treasure, be it never so precious.'
And certes he sholde nat be called a gentil man that after God and good conscience, alle thynges left,	And certainly he should not be called a gentle man who after God and good conscience, all other things left aside,
ne dooth his diligence and bisynesse to kepen his goode name.	does his best efforts and effort to keep his good name.
And Cassidore seith that `it is signe of a gentil herte	And Cassiodorus says that `it is sign of a gentle heart
whan a man loveth and desireth to han a good name.'	when a man loves and desires to have a good name.'
And therfore seith Seint Austyn that `ther been two thynges that arn necessarie and nedefulle,	And therefore says Saint Austin that `there are two things that are necessary and needful,
and that is good conscience and good loos;	and that is good conscience and good reputation;
that is to seyn, good conscience to thyn owene persone inward and good loos for thy neighebor outward.'	that is to say, good conscience to thine own person inward and good reputation for thy neighbor outward.'
And he that trusteth hym so muchel in his goode conscience	And he that trusts himself so much in his good conscience
that he displeseth, and setteth at noght his goode name or loos,	that he displeases, and sets at naught his good name or reputation,
and rekketh noght though he kepe nat his goode name, nys but a crueel cherl.	and cares not though he keep not his good name, is but a cruel churl.
"Sire, now have I shewed yow how ye shul do in getynge richesses, and how ye shullen usen hem,	"Sir, now have I showed you how you shall do in getting riches, and how you shall use them,
and I se wel that for the trust that ye han in youre richesses	and I see well that for the trust that you have in your riches
ye wole moeve werre and bataille.	you will provoke war and battle.
I conseille yow that ye bigynne no werre in trust of youre richesses,	I advise you that you begin no war in trust of your riches,
for they ne suffisen noght werres to mayntene.	for they do not suffice to maintain wars.
And therfore seith a philosophre, `That man that desireth and wole algates han werre, shal nevere have suffisaunce,	And therefore says a philosopher, `That man who desires and will continually have war, shall never have enough,
for the richer that he is, the gretter despenses moste he make, if he wole have worshipe and victorie.'	for the richer that he is, the greater expenditures must he make, if he will have worship and victory.'
And Salomon seith that `the gretter richesses that a man hath, the mo despendours he hath.'	And Solomon says that `the greater riches that a man has, the more spenders he has.'
And, deere sire, al be it so that for youre richesses ye mowe have muchel folk,	And, dear sir, although it be so that for your riches you can have much folk,
yet bihoveth it nat, ne it is nat good, to bigynne werre whereas ye mowe	yet it is not suitable, nor is it any good, to begin war whereas you can
in oother manere have pees unto youre worshipe and profit.	in another manner have peace unto your honor and advantage.
For the victorie of batailles that been in this world lyth nat in greet nombre or multitude	For the victory of battles that are in this world lies not in great number or multitude
of the peple, ne in the vertu of man,	of the people, nor in the strength of man,
but it lith in the wyl and in the hand of oure Lord God Almyghty.	but it lies in the will and in the hand of our Lord God Almighty.
And therfore Judas Machabeus, which was Goddes knyght,	And therefore Judas Machabeus, who was God's knight,
whan he sholde fighte agayn his adversarie that hadde a gretter nombre	when he had to fight against his adversary who has a greater number
and a gretter multitude of folk and strenger than was this peple of Machabee,	and a greater multitude of folk and stronger than was this people of Machabee,
yet he reconforted his litel compaignye, and seyde right in this wise:	yet he comforted his little company, and said exactly in this way:
`Als lightly,' quod he, `may oure Lord God Almyghty yeve victorie to a fewe folk as to many folk,	`As easily,' said he, `may our Lord God Almighty give victory to a few folk as to many folk,
for the victorie of a bataile comth nat by the grete nombre of peple,	for the victory of a battle comes not by the great number of people,
but it cometh from oure Lord God of hevene.'	but it comes from our Lord God of heaven.'
And, deere sire, for as muchel as ther is no man certein if he be worthy that	And, dear sir, since there is no man certain if he be worthy that
God yeve hym victorie . . . or not, in accordance with what Salomon seith,	God give him victory . . . or not, according to what Solomon says,
therfore every man sholde greetly drede werres to bigynne.	therefore every man should greatly dread to begin wars.
And by cause that in batailles fallen manye perils,	And because in battles many perils befall,
and happeth outher while that as soone is the grete man slayn as the litel man;	and happens another time that as soon is the great man slain as the little man;
and as it is writen in the seconde Book of Kynges,	and as it is written in the second Book of Kings,
`The dedes of batailles been aventurouse and nothyng certeyne,	`The deeds of battles are subject to chance and in no way certain,
for as lightly is oon hurt with a spere as another';	for as easily is one hurt with one spear as another';
and for ther is gret peril in werre, therfore sholde a man flee and eschue werre,	and for there is great peril in war, therefore should a man flee and shun war,
in as muchel as a man may goodly.	insomuch as a man may goodly (do so).
For Salomon seith, `He that loveth peril shal falle in peril.'"	For Solomon says, `He who loves peril shall fall in peril.'"
After that Dame Prudence hadde spoken in this manere, Melibee answerde and seyde,	After Dame Prudence had spoken in this manner, Melibee answered and said,
"I see wel, dame Prudence, that by youre faire wordes and by youre resouns	"I see well, dame Prudence, that by your fair words and by your reasons
that ye han shewed me, that the werre liketh yow no thyng;	that you have showed me, that the war not at all pleases you;
but I have nat yet herd youre conseil, how I shal do in this nede."	but I have not yet heard your advice, how I shall do in this urgent matter."
"Certes," quod she, "I conseille yow that ye accorde with youre adversaries and that ye have pees with hem.	"Certainly," said she, "I advise you that you agree with your adversaries and that you have peace with them.
For Seint Jame seith in his Epistles that `by concord and pees the smale richesses wexen grete,	For Saint James says in his Epistles that `by agreeent and peace the small riches wax great,
and by debaat and discord the grete richesses fallen doun.'	and by debate and discord the great riches fall down.'
And ye knowen wel that oon of the gretteste and moost sovereyn thyng	And you know well that one of the greatest and most excellent things
that is in this world is unytee and pees.	that is in this world is unity and peace.
And therfore seyde oure Lord Jhesu Crist to his apostles in this wise:	And therefore said our Lord Jesus Christ to his apostles in this manner:
`Wel happy and blessed been they that loven and purchacen pees, for they been called children of God.'"	`Well happy and blessed are they that love and bring about peace, for they are called children of God.'"
"A," quod Melibee, "now se I wel that ye loven nat myn honour ne my worshipe.	"A," said Melibee, "now see I well that you love not my honor nor my worthiness.
Ye knowen wel that myne adversaries han bigonnen this debaat and bryge by hire outrage,	You know well that my adversaries have begun this debate and strife by their outrage,
and ye se wel that they ne requeren ne preyen me nat of pees,	and you see well that they neither require nor pray me for peace,
ne they asken nat to be reconsiled.	nor they ask not to be reconciled.
Wol ye thanne that I go and meke me, and obeye me to hem, and crie hem mercy?	Will you then that I go and humble myself, and be subject to them, and beg them for mercy?
For sothe, that were nat my worshipe.	Indeed, that would not be to my honor.
For right as men seyn that `over-greet hoomlynesse engendreth dispreisynge,'	For just as men say that `over-great familiarity engenders contempt,'
 so fareth it by to greet humylitee or mekenesse."	so fares it by too great humility or meekness."
Thanne bigan dame Prudence to maken semblant of wratthe and seyde:	Then began dame Prudence to make the outward appearance of wrath and said:
"Certes, sire, sauf youre grace, I love youre honour and youre profit	"Certainly, sir, with all due respect to you, I love your honor and your well-being
as I do myn owene, and evere have doon;	as I do my own, and ever have done;
ne ye, ne noon oother, seyn nevere the contrarie.	nor you, nor any other, can say never the contrary.
And yit if I hadde seyd that ye sholde han purchaced the pees	And yet if I had said that you should have brought about the peace
and the reconsiliacioun, I ne hadde nat muchel mystaken me ne seyd amys.	and the reconciliation, I had not much mistaken me nor said amiss.
For the wise man seith, `The dissensioun bigynneth by another man,	For the wise man says, `The dissension begins by another man,
 and the reconsilyng bygynneth by thyself.'	and the reconciling begins by thyself.'
And the prophete seith, `Flee shrewednesse and do goodnesse;	And the prophet says, `Flee shrewdness and do goodness;
seke pees and folwe it, as muchel as in thee is.'	seek peace and follow it, as much as in thee is.'
Yet seye I nat that ye shul rather pursue to youre adversaries for pees than they shuln to yow.	Yet say I not that you should rather sue to your adversaries for peace than they should (offer peace) to you.
For I knowe wel that ye been so hard-herted that ye wol do no thyng for me.	For I know well that you are so hard-hearted that you will do nothing for me.
And Salomon seith, `He that hath over-hard an herte, atte laste he shal myshappe and mystyde.'"	And Solomon says, `He that has over-hard a heart, at the last he shall have bad luck and suffer misfortune.'"
Whanne Melibee hadde herd dame Prudence maken semblant of wratthe, he seyde in this wise:	When Melibee had heard dame Prudence make the appearance of wrath, he said in this manner:
"Dame, I prey yow that ye be nat displesed of thynges that I seye,	"Dame, I pray you that you be not displeased by things that I say,
for ye knowe wel that I am angry and wrooth, and that is no wonder;	for you know well that I am angry and wrathful, and that is no wonder;
and they that been wrothe witen nat wel what they don ne what they seyn.	and they that are wrathful know not well what they do nor what they say.
Therfore the prophete seith that `troubled eyen han no cleer sighte.'	Therefore the prophet says that `troubled eyes have no clear sight.'
But seyeth and conseileth me as yow liketh, for I am redy to do right as ye wol desire;	But say and advise me as you like, for I am ready to do just as you will desire;
and if ye repreve me of my folye,	and if you reprove me for my folly,
I am the moore holden to love yow and to preyse yow.	I am the more obligated to love you and to praise you.
For Salomon seith that `he that repreveth hym that dooth folye,	For Solomon says that `he that reproves him who does folly,
he shal fynde gretter grace than he that deceyveth hym by sweete wordes.'"	he shall find greater grace than he who deceives him by sweet words.'"
Thanne seide dame Prudence, "I make no semblant of wratthe ne anger, but for youre grete profit.	Then said dame Prudence, "I make no outward appearance of wrath nor anger, but for your great advantage.
For Salomon seith, `He is moore worth that repreveth or chideth a fool for his folye,	For Solomon says, `He is more worthy that reproves or chides a fool for his folly,
shewynge hym semblant of wratthe,	showing him the outward appearance of wrath,
than he that supporteth hym and preyseth hym in his mysdoynge and laugheth at his folye.'	than he who supports him and praises him in his misdoing and laughs at his folly.'
And this same Salomon seith afterward that	And this same Solomon says afterward that
`by the sorweful visage of a man'	`by the sorrowful visage of a man'
(that is to seyn by the sory and hevy contenaunce of a man)	(that is to say by the sorry and heavy countenance of a man)
`the fool correcteth and amendeth hymself.'"	`the fool corrects and amends himself.'"
Thanne seyde Melibee, "I shal nat konne answere to	Then said Melibee, "I shall not know how to answer to
so manye faire resouns as ye putten to me and shewen.	so many fair reasons as you set forth and show to me.
Seyeth shortly youre wyl and youre conseil, and I am al redy to fulfille and parfourne it."	Say shortly your will and your advice, and I am all ready to fulfill and perform it."
Thanne dame Prudence discovered al hir wyl to hym and seyde,	Then dame Prudence uncovered all her will to him and said,
"I conseille yow," quod she, "aboven alle thynges, that ye make pees bitwene God and yow,	"I advise you," said she, "above all things , that you make peace between God and you,
and beth reconsiled unto hym and to his grace.	and are reconciled unto him and to his grace.
For, as I have seyd yow heer biforn, God hath suffred yow	For, as I have said to you here before this, God has allowed you
to have this tribulacioun and disese for youre synnes.	to have this tribulation and suffering for your sins.
And if ye do as I sey yow, God wol sende youre adversaries unto yow	And if you do as I tell you, God will send your adversaries unto you
and maken hem fallen at youre feet, redy to do youre wyl and youre comandementz.	and make them fall at your feet, ready to do your will and your commandments.
For Salomon seith, `Whan the condicioun of man is plesaunt and likynge to God,	For Solomon says, `When the condition of man is pleasant and pleasing to God,
he chaungeth the hertes of the mannes adversaries and constreyneth hem to biseken hym of pees and of grace.'	he changes the hearts of the man's adversaries and constrains them to beseech him for peace and for grace.'
And I prey yow lat me speke with youre adversaries in privee place,	And I pray you let me speak with your adversaries in a private place,
for they shul nat knowe that it be of youre wyl or of youre assent.	for they must not know that it is of your will or of your assent.
And thanne, whan I knowe hir wil and hire entente, I may conseille yow the moore seurely."	And then, when I know their will and their intent, I can advise you the more surely."
"Dame," quod Melibee, "dooth youre wil and youre likynge;	"Dame," said Melibee, "do your will and your pleasure;
for I putte me hoolly in youre disposicioun and ordinaunce."	for I put me wholly in your disposition and ordinance."
Thanne dame Prudence, whan she saugh the goode wyl of hir housbonde, delibered and took avys in hirself,	Then dame Prudence, when she saw the good will of her husband, considered and pondered in herself,
thinkinge how she myghte brynge this nede unto a good conclusioun and to a good ende.	thinking how she might bring this urgent matter unto a good conclusion and to a good end.
And whan she saugh hir tyme, she sente for thise adversaries to come unto hire into a pryvee place	And when she saw her time, she sent for these adversaries to come unto her into a private place
and shewed wisely unto hem the grete goodes that comen of pees	and showed wisely unto them the great goods that come of peace
and the grete harmes and perils that been in werre,	and the great harms and perils that are in war,
and seyde to hem in a goodly manere hou that hem oughten have greet repentaunce	and said to them in a goodly manner how that they ought to have great repentance
of the injurie and wrong that they hadden doon to Melibee hir lord,	for the injury and wrong that they had done to Melibee her lord,
and unto hire, and to hire doghter.	and unto her, and to her daughter.
And whan they herden the goodliche wordes of dame Prudence,	And when they heard the goodly words of dame Prudence,
they weren so supprised and ravysshed and hadden so greet joye of hire that wonder was to telle.	they were so taken and ravished and had such great joy of her that it was a wonder to tell.
"A, lady," quod they, "ye han shewed unto us the blessynge of swetnesse,	"A, lady," said they, "you have showed unto us the blessing of sweetness,
after the sawe of David the prophete,	according to the saying of David the prophet,
for the reconsilynge which we been nat worthy to have in no manere,	for the reconciliation which we are not worthy to have in any manner,
but we oghte requeren it with greet contricioun and humylitee,	but we ought to request it with great contrition and humility,
ye of youre grete goodnesse have presented unto us.	that you of your great goodness have presented unto us.
Now se we wel that the science and the konnynge of Salomon is ful trewe.	Now see we well that the knowledge and the cunning of Solomon is very true.
For he seith that `sweete wordes multiplien and encreescen freendes	For he says that `sweet words multiply and increase friends
 and maken shrewes to be debonaire and meeke.'	and make scoundrels to be gentle and meek.'
"Certes," quod they, "we putten oure dede and al oure matere and cause al hoolly in youre goode wyl	"Certainly," said they, "we put our actions and all our matters and cause all wholly in your good will
and been redy to obeye to the speche and comandement of my lord Melibee.	and are ready to obey to the speech and commandment of my lord
And therfore, deere and benygne lady, we preien yow and biseke yow as mekely as we konne and mowen	And therefore, dear and benign lady, we pray you and beseech you as meekly as we know how and are able
that it lyke unto youre grete goodnesse to fulfillen in dede youre goodliche wordes,	that it be pleasing unto your great goodness to fulfill in deed your goodly words,
for we consideren and knowelichen that we han offended and greved my lord Melibee out of mesure,	for we consider and acknowledge that we have offended and grieved my lord Melibee out of measure,
so ferforth that we be nat of power to maken his amendes.	so far that we are not of power to make his amends.
And therfore we oblige and bynden us and oure freendes for to doon al his wyl and his comandementz.	And therefore we pledge and bind us and our friends to do all his will and his commandments.
But peraventure he hath swich hevynesse and swich wratthe to us-ward by cause of oure offense	But perhaps he has such heaviness and such wrath toward us because of our offense
that he wole enjoyne us swich a peyne as we mowe nat bere ne susteene.	that he will impose on us such a punishment as we can not bear nor sustain.
And therfore, noble lady, we biseke to youre wommanly pitee	And therefore, noble lady, we beseech to your womanly pity
to taken swich avysement in this nede that	to take such thought in this urgent matter that
we ne oure freendes be nat desherited ne destroyed thurgh oure folye."	we nor our friends are not dispossessed nor destroyed through our folly."
"Certes," quod Prudence, "it is an hard thyng and right perilous	"Certainly," said Prudence, "it is a hard thing and very perilous
that a man putte hym al outrely in the arbitracioun and juggement,	that a man put himself entirely in the power of decision and judgment,
and in the myght and power of his enemys.	and in the might and power of his enemies.
For Salomon seith, `Leeveth me, and yeveth credence to that I shal seyn: I seye,' quod he,	For Solomon says, `Believe me, and give credence to what I shall say: I say,' said he,
`ye peple, folk and governours of hooly chirche,	`you people, folk and governors of holy church,

ne yeve thou nevere myght ne maistrie of thy body whil thou lyvest.'	give thou never power (over) nor mastery of thy body while thou livest.'
Now sithen he deffendeth that man sholde nat yeven to his broother	Now since he forbids that a man should give to his brother
ne to his freend the myght of his body,	nor to his friend the control of his body,
by a strenger resoun he deffendeth and forbedeth a man to yeven hymself to his enemy.	by a stronger reason he prohibits and forbids a man to give himself to his enemy.
And nathelees I conseille you that ye mystruste nat my lord,	And nevertheless I advise you that you mistrust not my lord,
for I woot wel and knowe verraily that he is debonaire and meeke, large, curteys,	for I know well and know truly that he is gentle and humble, generous, courteous,
and nothyng desirous ne coveitous of good ne richesse.	and in no way desirous nor covetous of goods nor riches.
For ther nys nothyng in this world that he desireth, save oonly worshipe and honour.	For there is nothing in this world that he desires, save only worship and honor.
Forthermoore I knowe wel and am right seur that he shal nothyng doon in this nede withouten my conseil,	Furthermore I know well and am very sure that he shall do nothing in this urgent matter without my advice,
and I shal so werken in this cause that by the grace of oure Lord God	and I shall so work in this cause that by the grace of our Lord God
ye shul been reconsiled unto us."	you shall be reconciled unto us."
Thanne seyden they with o voys, "Worshipful lady, we putten us	Then said they with one voice, "Worshipful lady, we put us
and oure goodes al fully in youre wil and disposicioun,	and our goods all fully in your will and power,
and been redy to comen, what day that it like unto youre noblesse to lymyte us or assigne us,	and are ready to come, what day that it pleases unto your noblesse to limit us or assign us,

Whan dame Prudence hadde herd the answeres of thise men, she bad hem goon agayn prively;	When dame Prudence had heard the answers of these men, she bad them go again secretly;
and she retourned to hir lord Melibee, and tolde hym how she foond his adversaries ful repentant,	and she returned to her lord Melibee, and told him how she found his adversaries very repentant,
knowelechynge ful lowely hir synnes and trespas, and how they were redy to suffren all peyne,	acknowledging very lowly their sins and trespass, and how they were ready to suffer any punishment,
requirynge and preiynge hym of mercy and pitee.	requesting and praying him of mercy and pity.
Thanne seyde Melibee: "He is wel worthy to have pardoun	Then said Melibee: "He is well worthy to have pardon
and foryifnesse of his synne, that excuseth nat his synne	and forgiveness of his sin, who does not excuse his sin
but knowelecheth it and repenteth hym, axinge indulgence.	but acknowledges it and repents himself, asking indulgence.
For Senec seith, `Ther is the remissioun and foryifnesse, where as the confessioun is,'	For Seneca says, `There is the remission and forgiveness, where the confession is,'
for confessioun is neighebor to innocence.	for confession is neighbor to innocence.
And he seith in another place that `he that hath shame of his synne and knowlecheth	And he says in another place that `he who has shame of his sin and acknowledges
[it is worthy remissioun].' And therfore I assente and conferme me to have pees;	[it is worthy of having remission].' And therefore I assent and resolve myself to have peace;
but it is good that we do it nat withouten the assent and wyl of oure freendes."	but it is good that we do it not without the assent and will of our friends."
Thanne was Prudence right glad and joyeful and seyde:	Then was Prudence very glad and joyful and said:
"Certes, sire," quod she, "ye han wel and goodly answered,	"Certainly, sir," said she, "you have well and goodly answered,
for right as by the conseil, assent, and help of youre freendes	for just as by the advice, assent, and help of your friends

right so withouten hire conseil shul ye nat accorden yow ne have pees with youre adversaries.	just so without their advice shall you not reconcile yourself nor have peace with your adversaries.
For the lawe seith, `Ther nys no thyng so good by wey of kynde as a thyng	For the law says, `There is no thing so good in the natural course of events kind as for a thing
to be unbounde by hym that it was ybounde.'"	to be unbound by him who bound it.'"
And thanne dame Prudence withouten delay or tariynge sente anon hire messages for hire kyn	And then dame Prudence without delay or tarrying sent immediately her messages for her kin
and for hire olde freendes which that were trewe and wyse,	and for her old friends which that were true and wise,

as it is aboven expressed and declared,	as it is above expressed and declared,
and preyden hem that they wolde yeven hire avys and conseil what best were to doon in this nede.	and prayed them that they would give their counsel and advice what best were to do in this urgent matter.
And whan Melibees freendes hadde taken hire avys and deliberacioun of the forseide mateere,	And when Melibee's friends had taken her counsel and deliberation on the foresaid matter,
and hadden examyned it by greet bisynesse and greet diligence,	and had examined it by great effort and greet diligence,
they yave ful conseil for to have pees and reste,	they gave unqualified advice to have peace and rest,
and that Melibee sholde receyve with good herte his adversaries to foryifnesse and mercy.	and that Melibee should with good heart receive his adversaries to forgiveness and mercy.
And whan dame Prudence hadde herd the assent of hir lord Melibee, and the conseil of his freendes	And when dame Prudence had heard the assent of her lord Melibee, and the advice of his friends
accorde with hire wille and hire entencioun,	agree with her will and her intention,
she was wonderly glad in hire herte and seyde:	she was wonderfully glad in her heart and said:
"Ther is an old proverbe," quod she, "seith that `the goodnesse that thou mayst do this day, do it,	"There is an old proverb," said she, "which says that `the goodness that thou can do this day, do it,
and abide nat ne delaye it nat til tomorwe.'	and abide not nor delay it not till tomorrow.'
And therfore I conseille that ye sende youre messages, swiche as been discrete and wise,	And therefore I advise that you send your messengers, such as are discrete and wise,
unto youre adversaries, tellynge hem on youre bihalve	unto your adversaries, telling them on your behalf
that if they wole trete of pees and of accord,	that if they will negotiate about peace and about harmony,
that they shape hem withouten delay or tariyng to comen unto us."	that they prepare themselves without delay or tarrying to come unto us."
Which thyng parfourned was in dede.	Which thing was carried out in deed.
And whanne thise trespassours and repentynge folk of hire folies	And when these trespassers and folk repenting of their follies
-- that is to seyn, the adversaries of Melibee --	-- that is to say, the adversaries of Melibee --
hadden herd what thise messagers seyden unto hem,	had heard what these messengers said unto them,
they weren right glad and joyeful, and answereden ful mekely and benignely,	they were just glad and joyful, and answered very meekly and benignly,

and shopen hem withouten delay to go with the messagers	and prepared themselves without delay to go with the messengers
 and obeye to the comandement of hir lord Melibee.	and obey to the command of their lord Melibee.
And right anon they tooken hire wey to the court of Melibee,	And right away they took their way to the court of Melibee,
and tooken with hem somme of hire trewe freendes	and took with them some of their true friends
to maken feith for hem and for to been hire borwes.	to stand surety for them and to be their guarantors.
And whan they were comen to the presence of Melibee, he seyde hem thise wordes:	And when they were come to the presence of Melibee, he said to them these words:
"It standeth thus," quod Melibee, "and sooth it is, that ye,	"It stands thus," said Melibee, "and true it is, that you,
causelees and withouten skile and resoun,	causeless and without logical explanation and reason,
han doon grete injuries and wronges to me and to my wyf Prudence and to my doghter also.	have done great injuries and wrongs to me and to my wife Prudence and to my daughter also.
For ye han entred into myn hous by violence,	For you have entered into my house by violence,
and have doon swich outrage that alle men knowen wel that ye have disserved the deeth.	and have done such outrage that all men know well that you have deserved the death.
And therfore wol I knowe and wite of yow	And therefore will I know and learn of you

of me and of my wyf Prudence, or ye wol nat?"	of me and of my wife Prudence, or will you not?"
Thanne the wiseste of hem thre answerde for hem alle and seyde,	Then the wisest of them three answered for them all and said,
"Sire," quod he, "we knowen wel that we been unworthy to comen unto the court	"Sir," said he, "we know well that we are unworthy to come unto the court
of so greet a lord and so worthy as ye been.	of so great a lord and so worthy as you are.
For we han so greetly mystaken us, and han offended	For we have so greatly transgressed, and have offended
and agilt in swich a wise agayn youre heigh lordshipe	and done wrong in such a way against your high lordship
that trewely we han disserved the deeth.	that truly we have deserved the death.
But yet, for the grete goodnesse and debonairetee that al the world witnesseth of youre persone,	But yet, for the great goodness and gentleness that all the world witnesses of your person,
we submytten us to the excellence and benignitee of youre gracious lordshipe,	we submit ourselves to the excellence and benignity of your gracious lordship,
and been redy to obeie to alle youre comandementz,	and are ready to obey all your commandments,
bisekynge yow that of youre merciable pitee	beseeching you that of your merciful pity
 ye wol considere oure grete repentaunce and lowe submyssioun	you will consider our great repentance and low submission
and graunten us foryevenesse of oure outrageous trespas and offense.	and grant us forgiveness of our outrageous trespass and offense.
For wel we knowe that youre liberal grace and mercy	For well we know that your liberal grace and mercy

al be it that cursedly and dampnablely we han agilt agayn youre heigh lordshipe."	although it be so that cursedly and damnably we have sinned against your high lordship."
Thanne Melibee took hem up fro the ground ful benignely,	Then Melibee took them up from the ground very benignly,
and receyved hire obligaciouns and hir boondes by hire othes upon hire plegges and borwes,	and received their pledges and their bonds by their oaths upon their pledges and guarantors,
and assigned hem a certeyn day to retourne unto his court	and assigned them a certain day to return unto his court
for to accepte and receyve the sentence and juggement that Melibee wolde comande	to accept and receive the sentence and judgment that Melibee would command
to be doon on hem by the causes aforeseyd.	to be done on them by the causes aforesaid.
Whiche thynges ordeyned, every man retourned to his hous.	Which things arranged, every man returned to his house.
And whan that dame Prudence saugh hir tyme, she freyned and axed hir lord Melibee	And when dame Prudence saw her time, she questioned and asked her lord Melibee
what vengeance he thoughte to taken of his adversaries.	what vengeance he thought to take upon his adversaries.
To which Melibee answerde and seyde, "Certes," quod he, "I thynke and purpose me fully	To which Melibee answered and said, "Certainly," said he, "I think and purpose me fully
to desherite hem of al that evere they han and for to putte hem in exil for evere."	to dispossess them of all that ever they have and to put them in exile for ever."
"Certes," quod dame Prudence, "this were a crueel sentence and muchel agayn resoun.	"Certainly," said dame Prudence, "this would be a cruel sentence and much again reason.
For ye been riche ynough and han no nede of oother mennes good,	For you are rich enough and have no need of other men's wealth,
and ye myghte lightly in this wise gete yow a coveitous name,	and you might easily in this way get yourself a covetous name,
which is a vicious thyng, and oghte been eschued of every good man.	which is a vicious thing, and ought to be shunned by every good man.
For after the sawe of the word of the Apostle, `Coveitise is roote of alle harmes.'	For according to the saying of the word of the Apostle, `Greed is root of all harms.'
And therfore it were bettre for yow to lese so muchel good of youre owene	And therefore it were better for you to lose so much wealth of your own
than for to taken of hir good in this manere,	than to take their wealth in this manner,
for bettre it is to lesen good with worshipe than it is to wynne good with vileynye and shame.	for better it is to lose wealth with honor than it is to acquire wealth with villainy and shame.
And everi man oghte to doon his diligence and his bisynesse to geten hym a good name.	And every man ought to do his best efforts and his main concern to get himself a good name.
And yet shal he nat oonly bisie hym in kepynge of his good name,	And yet shall he not only busy himself in keeping of his good name,
but he shal also enforcen hym alwey to do somthyng by which he may renovelle his good name.	but he shall also strive always to do something by which he may renew his good name.
For it is writen that `the olde good loos or good name of a man is soone goon	For it is written that `the old good reputation or good name of a man is soon gone
and passed, whan it is nat newed ne renovelled.'	and passed, when it is not renewed nor restored.'
And as touchynge that ye seyn ye wole exile youre adversaries,	And as touching that you say you will exile your adversaries,
that thynketh me muchel agayn resoun and out of mesure,	that thinks me much against reason and out of measure,
considered the power that they han yeve yow upon hemself.	considered the power that they have given you upon themselves.
And it is writen that `he is worthy to lesen his privilege that mysuseth	And it is written that `he is worthy to lose his privilege that misuses
the myght and the power that is yeven hym.'	the might and the power that is given him.'
And I sette cas ye myghte enjoyne hem that peyne by right and by lawe,	And I assume (for the sake of argument) you might impose on them that punishment by justice and by law,
which I trowe ye mowe nat do;	which I believe you can not do;
I seye ye mighte nat putten it to execucioun peraventure,	I say perhaps you could not put it to execution,
and thanne were it likly to retourne to the werre as it was biforn.	and then it would be likely to return to the war as it was before.
And therfore, if ye wole that men do yow obeisance, ye moste deemen moore curteisly;	And therefore, if you want men to do you obedience, you must judge more courteously;
this is to seyn, ye moste yeven moore esy sentences and juggementz.	this is to say, you must give more easy sentences and judgments.
For it is writen that `he that moost curteisly comandeth, to hym men moost obeyen.'	For it is written that `he who most courteously commands, to him men most obey.'
And therfore I prey yow that in this necessitee and in this nede	And therefore I pray you that in this necessity and in this urgent matter
ye caste yow to overcome youre herte.	you endeavor to overcome your heart.
For Senec seith that `he that overcometh his herte overcometh twies.'	For Seneca says that `he that overcomes his heart overcomes twice.'
And Tullius seith, `Ther is no thyng so comendable in a greet lord	And Cicero says, `There is no thing so commendable in a great lord
as whan he is debonaire and meeke, and appeseth him lightly.'	as when he is gentle and meek, and calms himself easily.
And I prey yow that ye wole forbere now to do vengeance,	And I pray you that you will forbear now to do vengeance,
in swich a manere that youre goode name may be kept and conserved,	in such a manner that your good name may be kept and conserved,
and that men mowe have cause and mateere to preyse yow of pitee and of mercy,	and that men may have cause and matter to praise you for pity and for mercy,
and that ye have no cause to repente yow of thyng that ye doon.	and that you have no cause to repent yourself of thing that you do.
For Senec seith, `He overcometh in an yvel manere that repenteth hym of his victorie.'	For Seneca says, `He overcomes in an evil manner who repents himself of his victory.'
Wherfore I pray yow, lat mercy been in youre herte,	Wherefore I pray you, let mercy be in your heart,
to th' effect and entente that God Almighty have mercy on yow in his laste juggement.	to the effect and intent that God Almighty have mercy on you in his last judgment.
For Seint Jame seith in his Epistle: `Juggement withouten mercy shal be doon	For Saint James says in his Epistle: `Judgment without mercy shall be done
to hym that hath no mercy of another wight.'"	to him that has no mercy for another person.'"
Whanne Melibee hadde herd the grete skiles and resouns of	When Melibee had heard the great logical arguments and reasons of
dame Prudence, and hire wise informaciouns and techynges,	dame Prudence, and her wise counsels and teachings,
his herte gan enclyne to the wil of his wif, considerynge hir trewe entente,	his heart began to incline to the will of his wife, considering her true intent,
and conformed hym anon and assented fully to werken after hir conseil,	and conformed him immediately and assented fully to work according to her advice,
and thonked God, of whom procedeth al vertu and alle goodnesse,	and thanked God, of whom proceeds all virtue and all goodness,
that hym sente a wyf of so greet discrecioun.	that sent him a wife of so great discretion.
And whan the day cam that his adversaries sholde appieren in his presence,	And when the day came that his adversaries should appear in his presence,
he spak unto hem ful goodly, and seyde in this wyse:	he spoke unto them very goodly, and said in this manner:
"Al be it so that of youre pride and heigh presumpcioun	"Although it be so that of your pride and high presumption
and folie, and of youre necligence and unkonnynge,	and folly, and of your negligence and ignorance,
ye have mysborn yow and trespassed unto me,	you have misbehaved yourself and trespassed unto me,
yet for as muche as I see and biholde youre grete humylitee	yet forasmuch as I see and behold your great humility
and that ye been sory and repentant of youre giltes,	and that you are sorry and repentant of your guilts,
it constreyneth me to doon yow grace and mercy.	it constrains me to do you grace and mercy.
Wherfore I receyve yow to my grace	Wherefore I receive you to my grace

The Prologe of the Frankeleyns Tale	The Prologue of the Franklin's Tale
Thise olde gentil Britouns in hir dayes	These old noble Bretons in their days
Of diverse aventures maden layes,	Of diverse adventures made lays,
Rymeyed in hir firste Briton tonge,	Rhymed in their first Breton tongue,
Whiche layes with hir instrumentz they songe	Which lays with their instruments they sang
Or elles redden hem for hir plesaunce;	Or else read them for their pleasure;
And oon of hem have I in remembraunce,	And one of them have I in remembrance,
Which I shal seyn with good wyl as I kan.	Which I shall say with as good will as I can.
But, sires, by cause I am a burel man,	But, sirs, because I am an unlearned man,
At my bigynnyng first I yow biseche,	At my beginning first I you beseech,
Have me excused of my rude speche.	Have me excused for my rude speech.
I lerned nevere rethorik, certeyn;	I learned never rhetoric, certainly;
Thyng that I speke, it moot be bare and pleyn.	Thing that I speak, it must be bare and plain.
I sleep nevere on the Mount of Pernaso,	I slept never on the Mount of Parnassus,
Ne lerned Marcus Tullius Scithero.	Nor learned Marcus Tullius Cicero.
Colours ne knowe I none, withouten drede,	Colors know I none, without doubt,
But swiche colours as growen in the mede,	But such colors as grow in the field,
Or elles swiche as men dye or peynte.	Or else such as men dye or paint.
Colours of rethoryk been to me queynte;	Colors of rhetoric (figures of speech) are strange to me;
My spirit feeleth noght of swich mateere.	My spirit feels nothing of such matter.
But if yow list, my tale shul ye heere.	But if you wish, you shall hear my tale.
Here bigynneth the Frankeleyns Tale	Here begins the Franklin's Tale.
In Armorik, that called is Britayne,	In Armorica, that is called Brittany,
Ther was a knyght that loved and dide his payne	There was a knight that loved and worked hard
To serve a lady in his beste wise;	To serve a lady in his best manner;
And many a labour, many a greet emprise,	And many a labor, many a great chivalric exploit,
He for his lady wroghte er she were wonne.	He wrought for his lady before she was won.
For she was oon the faireste under sonne,	For she was the fairest of all under the sun,
And eek therto comen of so heigh kynrede	And also moreover come of such noble ancestry
That wel unnethes dorste this knyght, for drede,	That this knight hardly dared, for fear,
Telle hire his wo, his peyne, and his distresse.	Tell her his woe, his pain, and his distress.
But atte laste she, for his worthynesse,	But at the last she, for his worthiness,
And namely for his meke obeysaunce,	And namely for his meek submission,
Hath swich a pitee caught of his penaunce	Has taken such a pity on his suffering
That pryvely she fil of his accord	That privately she agreed with him
To take hym for hir housbonde and hir lord,	To take him for her husband and hir lord,
Of swich lordshipe as men han over hir wyves.	Of such lordship as men have over their wives.
And for to lede the moore in blisse hir lyves,	And to lead the more blissfully their lives,
Of his free wyl he swoor hire as a knyght	Of his free will he swore her as a knight
That nevere in al his lyf he, day ne nyght,	That never in all his life he, day or night,
Ne sholde upon hym take no maistrie	Should take upon himself any mastery
Agayn hir wyl, ne kithe hire jalousie,	Against her will, nor show her jealousy,
But hire obeye, and folwe hir wyl in al,	But obey her, and follow her will in everything,
As any lovere to his lady shal,	As any lover to his lady should,
Save that the name of soveraynetee,	Except for the appearance of sovereignty,
That wolde he have for shame of his degree.	Which he would have to avoid bringing shame on his status (of knighthood).
She thanked hym, and with ful greet humblesse	She thanked him, and with full great humbleness
She seyde, "Sire, sith of youre gentillesse	She said, "Sir, since of your nobility
Ye profre me to have so large a reyne,	You offer me to have such freedom from restraint,
Ne wolde nevere God bitwixe us tweyne,	And would God that never between us two,
As in my gilt, were outher werre or stryf.	Through my fault, should be either war or strife.
Sire, I wol be youre humble trewe wyf --	Sir, I will be your humble true wife --
Have heer my trouthe -- til that myn herte breste."	Have here my pledge -- until my heart bursts (until I die)."
Thus been they bothe in quiete and in reste.	Thus are they both in quiet and in peace.
For o thyng, sires, saufly dar I seye,	For one thing, sirs, I dare say confidently,
That freendes everych oother moot obeye,	That friends must obey each other,
If they wol longe holden compaignye.	If they will long hold company.
Love wol nat been constreyned by maistrye.	Love will not be constrained by mastery.
Whan maistrie comth, the God of Love anon	When mastery comes, the God of Love immediately
Beteth his wynges, and farewel, he is gon!	Beats his wings, and farewell, he is gone!
Love is a thyng as any spirit free.	Love is a thing free as any spirit.
Wommen, of kynde, desiren libertee,	Women, by nature, desire liberty,
And nat to been constreyned as a thral;	And not to be constrained like a slave;
And so doon men, if I sooth seyen shal.	And so do men, if I shall say the truth.
Looke who that is moost pacient in love,	Look who is most patient in love,
He is at his avantage al above.	He is in the best position, superior to all.
Pacience is an heigh vertu, certeyn,	Patience is a noble virtue, certainly,
For it venquysseth, as thise clerkes seyn,	For it vanquishes, as these clerks say,
Thynges that rigour sholde nevere atteyne.	Things that rigor should never attain.
For every word men may nat chide or pleyne.	One may not chide or complain for every word.
Lerneth to suffre, or elles, so moot I goon,	Learn to suffer, or else, as I may walk (I swear),
Ye shul it lerne, wher so ye wole or noon;	You shall learn it, whether you want to or not;
For in this world, certein, ther no wight is	For in this world, certainly, there is no person
That he ne dooth or seith somtyme amys.	Who does not sometime do or speak amiss.
Ire, siknesse, or constellacioun,	Ire, sickness, or the position of the stars,
Wyn, wo, or chaungynge of complexioun	Wine, woe, or changing of the balance of bodily humors
Causeth ful ofte to doon amys or speken.	Causes (one) very often to do or speak amiss.
On every wrong a man may nat be wreken.	On every wrong a man can not be avenged.
After the tyme moste be temperaunce	There must be moderation suitable to the occasion
To every wight that kan on governaunce.	By every person who knows about governance.
And therfore hath this wise, worthy knyght,	And therefore has this wise, worthy knight,
To lyve in ese, suffrance hire bihight,	To live in ease, promised her forbearance,
And she to hym ful wisly gan to swere	And she to him full truly did swear
That nevere sholde ther be defaute in here.	That never should there be fault in her.
Heere may men seen an humble, wys accord;	Here may men see a humble, wise accord;
Thus hath she take hir servant and hir lord --	Thus has she taken her servant and her lord --
Servant in love, and lord in mariage.	Servant in love, and lord in marriage.
Thanne was he bothe in lordshipe and servage.	Then was he both in lordship and servitude.
Servage? Nay, but in lordshipe above,	Servitude? Nay, but in lordship above,
Sith he hath bothe his lady and his love;	Since he has both his lady and his love;
His lady, certes, and his wyf also,	His lady, certainly, and his wife also,
The which that lawe of love acordeth to.	The which accords to the law of love.
And whan he was in this prosperitee,	And when he was in this happy state,
Hoom with his wyf he gooth to his contree,	Home with his wife he goes to his country,
Nat fer fro Pedmark, ther his dwellyng was,	Not far from Pedmark, where his dwelling was,
Where as he lyveth in blisse and in solas.	Where he lives in bliss and in pleasure.
Who koude telle, but he hadde wedded be,	Who could tell, unless he had been wedded,
The joye, the ese, and the prosperitee	The joy, the ease, and the happiness
That is bitwixe an housbonde and his wyf?	That is between a husband and his wife?
A yeer and moore lasted this blisful lyf,	A year and more lasted this blissful life,
Til that the knyght of which I speke of thus,	Until the knight of whom I thus speak,
That of Kayrrud was cleped Arveragus,	That was called Arveragus of Kayrrud,
Shoop hym to goon and dwelle a yeer or tweyne	Prepared himself to go and dwell a year or two
In Engelond, that cleped was eek Briteyne,	In England, which was also called Britain,
To seke in armes worshipe and honour --	To seek in arms good reputation and honor --
For al his lust he sette in swich labour --	For he set all his desire in such labor --
And dwelled there two yeer; the book seith thus.	And dwelled there two years; the book says thus.
Now wol I stynten of this Arveragus,	Now will I stop (speaking) of this Arveragus,
And speken I wole of Dorigen his wyf,	And I will speak of Dorigen his wife,
That loveth hire housbonde as hire hertes lyf.	Who loves her husband as her heart's life.
For his absence wepeth she and siketh,	For his absence she weeps and sighs,
As doon thise noble wyves whan hem liketh.	As do these noble wives when it pleases them.
She moorneth, waketh, wayleth, fasteth, pleyneth;	She mourns, stays awake, wails, fasts, complains;
Desir of his presence hire so destreyneth	Desire of his presence so presses upon her
That al this wyde world she sette at noght.	That all this wide world she reckoned as worth nothing.
Hire freendes, whiche that knewe hir hevy thoght,	Her friends, who knew her gloomy thought,
Conforten hire in al that ever they may.	Comfort her in all that ever they can.
They prechen hire, they telle hire nyght and day	They preach to her, they tell her night and day
That causelees she sleeth hirself, allas!	That she slays herself without cause, alas!
And every confort possible in this cas	And every comfort possible in this case
They doon to hire with al hire bisynesse,	They do to her with all their concern,
Al for to make hire leve hire hevynesse.	All to make her leave her sadness.
By proces, as ye knowen everichoon,	In the course of time, as every one of you knows,
Men may so longe graven in a stoon	One may so long engrave on a stone
Til som figure therinne emprented be.	Until some figure is imprinted upon it.
So longe han they conforted hire til she	So long have they comforted her until she
Receyved hath, by hope and by resoun,	Received has, by hope and by reason,
The emprentyng of hire consolacioun,	The imprint of their consolation,
Thurgh which hir grete sorwe gan aswage;	Through which her great sorrow began to be relieved;
She may nat alwey duren in swich rage.	She can not always continue in such passionate grief.
And eek Arveragus, in al this care,	And also Arveragus, in (the midst of) all this care,
Hath sent hire lettres hoom of his welfare,	Has sent her letters home (telling) of his welfare,
And that he wol come hastily agayn;	And that he will come hastily again;
Or elles hadde this sorwe hir herte slayn.	Or else this sorrow would have slain her heart.
Hire freendes sawe hir sorwe gan to slake	Her friends saw her sorrow began to slacken
And preyde hire on knees, for Goddes sake,	And prayed her on their knees, for God's sake,
To come and romen hire in compaignye,	To come and walk about in company,
Awey to dryve hire derke fantasye.	Away to drive her dark imagining.
And finally she graunted that requeste,	And finally she granted that request,
For wel she saugh that it was for the beste.	For well she saw that it was for the best.
Now stood hire castel faste by the see,	Now her castle stood close by the sea,
And often with hire freendes walketh shee	And often with her friends she walks
Hire to disporte upon the bank an heigh,	To amuse herself upon the bank on high,
Where as she many a ship and barge seigh	Where she saw many a ship and sailing vessel
Seillynge hir cours, where as hem liste go.	Sailing their course, where it pleases them to go.
But thanne was that a parcel of hire wo,	But then was that a portion of her woe,
For to hirself ful ofte, "Allas!" seith she,	For to herself full often, she says "Alas!",
"Is ther no ship, of so manye as I se,	"Is there no ship, of so many as I see,
Wol bryngen hom my lord? Thanne were myn herte	Will bring home my lord? Then would my heart be
Al warisshed of his bittre peynes smerte."	All cured of its bitter, sharp pains."
Another tyme ther wolde she sitte and thynke,	Another time there would she sit and think,
And caste hir eyen dounward fro the brynke.	And cast her eyes downward from the brink.
But whan she saugh the grisly rokkes blake,	But when she saw the grisly black rocks,
For verray feere so wolde hir herte quake	For sheer fear her heart would so quake
That on hire feet she myghte hire noght sustene.	That on her feet she could not sustain herself.
Thanne wolde she sitte adoun upon the grene,	Then would she sit down upon the green,
And pitously into the see biholde,	And piteously stare into the sea,
And seyn right thus, with sorweful sikes colde:	And say right thus, with sorrowful, cold sighs:
"Eterne God, that thurgh thy purveiaunce	"Eternal God, who through thy foreknowledge
Ledest the world by certein governaunce,	Leads the world by sure governance,
In ydel, as men seyn, ye no thyng make.	Men say you make nothing in vain.
But, Lord, thise grisly feendly rokkes blake,	But, Lord, these grisly fiendish black rocks,
That semen rather a foul confusion	That seem rather a foul confusion
Of werk than any fair creacion	Of work than any fair creation
Of swich a parfit wys God and a stable,	Of such a perfectly wise and stable God,
Why han ye wroght this werk unresonable?	Why have you created this unreasonable work?
For by this werk, south, north, ne west, ne eest,	For by this work, south, north, nor west, nor east,
Ther nys yfostred man, ne bryd, ne beest;	There is no benefit to man, nor bird, nor beast;
It dooth no good, to my wit, but anoyeth.	It does no good, to my understanding, but does harm.
Se ye nat, Lord, how mankynde it destroyeth?	See you not, Lord, how it destroys mankind?
An hundred thousand bodyes of mankynde	A hundred thousand bodies of mankind
Han rokkes slayn, al be they nat in mynde,	Have rocks slain, although their names are forgotten,
Which mankynde is so fair part of thy werk	And this mankind is so fair a part of thy work
That thou it madest lyk to thyn owene merk.	That thou made it like to thine own image.
Thanne semed it ye hadde a greet chiertee	Then it seemed you had a great love
Toward mankynde; but how thanne may it bee	Toward mankind; but how then may it be
That ye swiche meenes make it to destroyen,	That you make such means to destroy it,
Whiche meenes do no good, but evere anoyen?	Which means do no good, but always cause trouble?
I woot wel clerkes wol seyn as hem leste,	I know well clerks will say as they please,
By argumentz, that al is for the beste,	By logical reasoning, that all is for the best,
Though I ne kan the causes nat yknowe.	Though I can not know the causes.
But thilke God that made wynd to blowe	But that same God that made wind to blow
As kepe my lord! This my conclusion.	Keep my lord! This is my conclusion.
To clerkes lete I al disputison.	To clerks I leave all disputation.
But wolde God that alle thise rokkes blake	But would God that all these black rocks
Were sonken into helle for his sake!	Were sunk into hell for his sake!
Thise rokkes sleen myn herte for the feere."	These rocks slay my heart for fear."
Thus wolde she seyn, with many a pitous teere.	Thus would she say, with many a piteous tear.
Hire freendes sawe that it was no disport	Her friends saw that it was no pleasure
To romen by the see, but disconfort,	To roam by the sea, but discomfort,
And shopen for to pleyen somwher elles.	And decide to amuse themselves somewhere else.
They leden hire by ryveres and by welles,	They lead her by rivers and by springs,
And eek in othere places delitables;	And also in other delightful places;
They dauncen and they pleyen at ches and tables.	They dance and they play at chess and backgammon.
So on a day, right in the morwe-tyde,	So on a day, early in the morning-tide,
Unto a gardyn that was ther bisyde,	Unto a garden that was there nearby,
In which that they hadde maad hir ordinaunce	In which they had made their arrangement
Of vitaille and of oother purveiaunce,	For victuals and for other provisions,
They goon and pleye hem al the longe day.	They go and amuse themselves all the long day.
And this was on the sixte morwe of May,	And this was on the sixth morning of May,
Which May hadde peynted with his softe shoures	Which May had painted with its soft showers
This gardyn ful of leves and of floures;	This garden full of leaves and of flowers;
And craft of mannes hand so curiously	And craft of man's hand so skillfully
Arrayed hadde this gardyn, trewely,	Had adorned this garden, truly,
That nevere was ther gardyn of swich prys	That never was there garden of such worth
But if it were the verray paradys.	Unless it were the true paradise.
The odour of floures and the fresshe sighte	The odor of flowers and the fresh sight
Wolde han maked any herte lighte	Would have made any heart light
That evere was born, but if to greet siknesse	That ever was born, unless too great sickness
Or to greet sorwe helde it in distresse,	Or too great sorrow held it in distress,
So ful it was of beautee with plesaunce.	It was so full of beauty with pleasure.
At after-dyner gonne they to daunce,	After dinner they go to dance,
And synge also, save Dorigen allone,	And sing also, save Dorigen alone,
Which made alwey hir compleint and hir moone,	Who made always her complaint and her moan,
For she ne saugh hym on the daunce go	For she did not see him on the dance go
That was hir housbonde and hir love also.	Who was her husband and her love also.
But nathelees she moste a tyme abyde	But nonetheless she must a time abide
And with good hope lete hir sorwe slyde.	And with good hope let her sorrow slip away.
Upon this daunce, amonges othere men,	In this dance, among other men,
Daunced a squier biforn Dorigen,	Danced a squire before Dorigen,
That fressher was and jolyer of array,	Who was more lively and more gaily dressed,
As to my doom, than is the month of May.	As to my judgement, than is the month of May.
He syngeth, daunceth, passynge any man	He sings, dances, passing any man
That is, or was, sith that the world bigan.	That is, or was, since the world began.
Therwith he was, if men sholde hym discryve,	Therewith he was, if one should him describe,
Oon of the beste farynge man on lyve;	One of the most handsome men alive;
Yong, strong, right vertuous, and riche, and wys,	Young, strong, very valiant, and rich, and wise,
And wel biloved, and holden in greet prys.	And well beloved, and held in great esteem.
And shortly, if the sothe I tellen shal,	And shortly, if I shall tell the truth,
Unwityng of this Dorigen at al,	Unknown by this Dorigen at all,
This lusty squier, servant to Venus,	This lusty squire, servant to Venus,
Which that ycleped was Aurelius,	Who was called Aurelius,
Hadde loved hire best of any creature	Had loved her best of any creature
Two yeer and moore, as was his aventure,	Two years and more, as was his fate,
But nevere dorste he tellen hire his grevaunce.	But he never dared tell her his grievance.
Withouten coppe he drank al his penaunce.	Copiously he drank all his penance (suffered intensely).
He was despeyred; no thyng dorste he seye,	He was in despair; he dared say nothing,
Save in his songes somwhat wolde he wreye	Except in his songs somewhat he would reveal
His wo, as in a general compleynyng;	His woe, as in a general lament;
He seyde he lovede and was biloved no thyng.	He said he loved and was in no way loved in return
Of swich matere made he manye layes,	Of such subject matter made he many lays,
Songes, compleintes, roundels, virelayes,	Songs, complaints, roundels, virelays,
How that he dorste nat his sorwe telle,	(Saying) how he dared not his sorrow tell,
But langwissheth as a furye dooth in helle;	But suffers as a fury does in hell;
And dye he moste, he seyde, as dide Ekko	And he must die, he said, as did Echo
For Narcisus, that dorste nat telle hir wo.	For Narcissus, she who dared not tell her woe.
In oother manere than ye heere me seye,	In other ways than you hear me say,
Ne dorste he nat to hire his wo biwreye,	He dared not reveal to her his woe,
Save that, paraventure, somtyme at daunces,	Except that, by chance, sometimes at dances,
Ther yonge folk kepen hir observaunces,	Where young folk observe their customs (of courtship),
It may wel be he looked on hir face	It may well be he looked on her face
In swich a wise as man that asketh grace;	In such a manner as a man that asks for grace;
But nothyng wiste she of his entente.	But she knew nothing of his intent.
Nathelees it happed, er they thennes wente,	Nonetheless it happened, before they went away,
By cause that he was hire neighebour,	Because he was her neighbor,
And was a man of worshipe and honour,	And was a man of good reputation and honor,
And hadde yknowen hym of tyme yoore,	And (she) had known him for a long time,
They fille in speche; and forth, moore and moore,	They fell in speech; and forth, more and more,
Unto his purpos drough Aurelius,	Unto his purpose drew Aurelius,
And whan he saugh his tyme, he seyde thus:	And when he saw his time, he said thus:
"Madame," quod he, "by God that this world made,	"Madame," he said, "by God that this world made,
So that I wiste it myghte youre herte glade,	Providing that I knew it might gladden your heart,
I wolde that day that youre Arveragus	I wish that day that your Arveragus
Wente over the see, that I, Aurelius,	Went over the sea, that I, Aurelius,
Hadde went ther nevere I sholde have come agayn.	Had went from where I should never have come back.
For wel I woot my servyce is in vayn;	For well I know my service is in vain;
My gerdon is but brestyng of myn herte.	My reward is but the breaking of my heart.
Madame, reweth upon my peynes smerte;	Madame, have pity upon my bitter pains;
For with a word ye may me sleen or save.	For with one word you may me slay or save.
Heere at youre feet God wolde that I were grave!	Here at your feet would God that I were buried!
I ne have as now no leyser moore to seye;	I have now no opportunity to say more;
Have mercy, sweete, or ye wol do me deye!"	Have mercy, sweet, or you will make me die!"
She gan to looke upon Aurelius;	She did look upon Aurelius;
"Is this youre wyl," quod she, "and sey ye thus?	"Is this your desire," said she, "and say you thus?
Nevere erst," quod she, "ne wiste I what ye mente.	Never before," she said, "Did I know what you meant.
But now, Aurelie, I knowe youre entente,	But now, Aurelius, I know your intention,
By thilke God that yaf me soule and lyf,	By that same God that gave me soul and life,
Ne shal I nevere been untrewe wyf	I shall never be an untrue wife
In word ne werk, as fer as I have wit;	In word nor deed, so long as I have my wits;
I wol been his to whom that I am knyt.	I will be his to whom that I am knit.
Taak this for fynal answere as of me."	Take this for my final answer."
But after that in pley thus seyde she:	But after that in play thus she said:
"Aurelie," quod she, "by heighe God above,	"Aurelius," she said, "by high God above,
Yet wolde I graunte yow to been youre love,	Yet would I grant you to be your love,
Syn I yow se so pitously complayne.	Since I see you so piteously lament.
Looke what day that endelong Britayne	On whatever day that from end to end of Brittany
Ye remoeve alle the rokkes, stoon by stoon,	You remove all the rocks, stone by stone,
That they ne lette ship ne boot to goon --	So that they do not prevent ship nor boat to go --
I seye, whan ye han maad the coost so clene	I say, when you have made the coast so clean
Of rokkes that ther nys no stoon ysene,	Of rocks that there is no stone seen,
Thanne wol I love yow best of any man;	Then will I love you best of any man;
Have heer my trouthe, in al that evere I kan."	Have here my pledged word, in all that is in my power."
"Is ther noon oother grace in yow?" quod he.	"Is there no other grace in you?" he said.
"No, by that Lord," quod she, "that maked me!	"No, by that Lord," she said, "that made me!
For wel I woot that it shal never bityde.	For well I know that it shall never happen.
Lat swiche folies out of youre herte slyde.	Let such follies pass out of your heart.
What deyntee sholde a man han in his lyf	What pleasure should a man have in his life
For to go love another mannes wyf,	To go love another man's wife,
That hath hir body whan so that hym liketh?"	Who has her body whenever he pleases?"
Aurelius ful ofte soore siketh;	Aurelius very often bitterly sighs;
Wo was Aurelie whan that he this herde,	Woe was Aurelius when he heard this,
And with a sorweful herte he thus answerde:	And with a sorrowful heart he thus answered:
"Madame," quod he, "this were an inpossible!	"Madame," he said, "this would be an impossiblity!
Thanne moot I dye of sodeyn deth horrible."	Then I must die of sudden horrible death."
And with that word he turned hym anon.	And with that word he turned away immediately.
Tho coome hir othere freendes many oon,	Then came her other friends many a one,
And in the aleyes romeden up and doun,	And in the garden paths roamed up and down,
And nothyng wiste of this conclusioun,	And knew nothing of this business,
But sodeynly bigonne revel newe	But suddenly began to revel anew
Til that the brighte sonne loste his hewe;	Until the bright sun lost its hue;
For th' orisonte hath reft the sonne his lyght --	For the horizon has bereft the sun of its light --
This is as muche to seye as it was nyght --	This is as much to say that it was night --
And hoom they goon in joye and in solas,	And home they go in joy and in pleasure,
Save oonly wrecche Aurelius, allas!	Save only wretched Aurelius, alas!
He to his hous is goon with sorweful herte.	He to his house is gone with sorrowful heart.
He seeth he may nat fro his deeth asterte;	He sees he can not escape from his death;
Hym semed that he felte his herte colde.	He thought that he felt his heart grow cold.
Up to the hevene his handes he gan holde,	Up to the heaven his hands he did hold,
And on his knowes bare he sette hym doun,	And on his bare knees he set himself down,
And in his ravyng seyde his orisoun.	And in his delirium said his prayer.
For verray wo out of his wit he breyde.	For utter woe out of his wits he suddenly went.

Unto the goddes, and first unto the sonne:	Unto the gods, and first unto the sun:

The hyeste rokke in Armorik Briteyne;	The highest rock in Armorican Brittany;
And lat this flood endure yeres tweyne.	And let this flood-tide endure for two years.
Thanne certes to my lady may I seye,	Then certainly to my lady may I say,
`Holdeth youre heste, the rokkes been aweye.'	`Keep your promise, the rocks are away.'
"Lord Phebus, dooth this miracle for me.	"Lord Phoebus, do this miracle for me.

And with that word in swowne he fil adoun,	And with that word he fell down in a faint,
And longe tyme he lay forth in a traunce.	And for a long time he lay in a trance.
His brother, which that knew of his penaunce,	His brother, who knew of his suffering,
Up caughte hym and to bedde he hath hym broght.	Caught him up and to bed he has him brought.
Dispeyred in this torment and this thoght	Despaired in this torment and this thought
Lete I this woful creature lye;	I leave this woeful creature lying;
Chese he, for me, wheither he wol lyve or dye.	Let him choose, for all I care, whether he will live or die.

If any wight hadde spoke, whil he was oute,	If any person had spoken, while he was away,
To hire of love; he hadde of it no doute.	To her of love; he had of it no fear.
He noght entendeth to no swich mateere,	He pays no attention to any such matter,
But daunceth, justeth, maketh hire good cheere;	But dances, jousts, makes her good cheer;
And thus in joye and blisse I lete hem dwelle,	And thus in joy and bliss I let them dwell,
And of the sike Aurelius wol I telle.	And of the sick Aurelius I will tell.
In langour and in torment furyus	In suffering and in hellish torment
Two yeer and moore lay wrecche Aurelyus,	Two years and more lay wretched Aurelius,
Er any foot he myghte on erthe gon;	Before he could set a foot on the ground;
Ne confort in this tyme hadde he noon,	Nor had he any comfort in this time,
Save of his brother, which that was a clerk.	Except from his brother, who was a clerk.
He knew of al this wo and al this werk,	He knew of all this woe and all this suffering,
For to noon oother creature, certeyn,	For to no other creature, certainly,
Of this matere he dorste no word seyn.	He dared say any word of this matter.
Under his brest he baar it moore secree	Under his breast he bore it more secretly
Than evere dide Pamphilus for Galathee.	Than ever did Pamphilus for Galathee.
His brest was hool, withoute for to sene,	His breast was unhurt, in outward appearance,
But in his herte ay was the arwe kene.	But in his heart ever was the sharp arrow.
And wel ye knowe that of a sursanure	And well you know that for a wound healed only on the surface
In surgerye is perilous the cure,	In surgery the treatment is perilous,
But men myghte touche the arwe or come therby.	Unless one could touch the arrow or grasp it.
His brother weep and wayled pryvely,	His brother wept and wailed secretly,
Til atte laste hym fil in remembraunce,	Until at the last he remembered,
That whiles he was at Orliens in Fraunce --	That while he was at Orleans in France --
As yonge clerkes that been lykerous	As young clerks that are eager
To reden artes that been curious	To read arts that are arcane
Seken in every halke and every herne	Seek in every nook and every cranny
Particuler sciences for to lerne --	To learn specialized branches of learning --
He hym remembred that, upon a day,	He remembered that, one day,
At Orliens in studie a book he say	At Orleans in a study hall he saw a book
Of magyk natureel, which his felawe,	Of natural science, which his fellow,
That was that tyme a bacheler of lawe,	Who was at that time a bachelor of law,
Al were he ther to lerne another craft,	Although he was there to learn another craft,
Hadde prively upon his desk ylaft;	Had covertly left upon his desk;
Which book spak muchel of the operaciouns	Which book spoke much of the operations
Touchynge the eighte and twenty mansiouns	Concerning the eight and twenty stations
That longen to the moone, and swich folye	That belong to the moon, and such folly
As in oure dayes is nat worth a flye --	As in our days is not worth a fly --
For hooly chirches feith in oure bileve	For holy church's faith in our belief
Ne suffreth noon illusioun us to greve.	Does not allow any illusion to grieve us.
And whan this book was in his remembraunce,	And when this book was in his remembrance,
Anon for joye his herte gan to daunce,	Straightway for joy his heart began to dance,
And to hymself he seyde pryvely:	And to himself he said secretly,
"My brother shal be warisshed hastily;	"My brother shall be cured speedily;
For I am siker that ther be sciences	For I am sure that there are sciences
By whiche men make diverse apparences,	By which men make diverse illusions,
Swiche as thise subtile tregetoures pleye.	Such as these subtle illusionists play.
For ofte at feestes have I wel herd seye	For often at feasts have I well heard say
That tregetours withinne an halle large	That illusionists within a large hall
Have maad come in a water and a barge,	Have made come in a water and a barge,
And in the halle rowen up and doun.	And in the hall row up and down.
Somtyme hath semed come a grym leoun;	Sometimes a grim lion has seemed to come;
And somtyme floures sprynge as in a mede;	And sometimes flowers spring as in a field;
Somtyme a vyne, and grapes white and rede;	Sometimes a vine, and grapes white and red;
Somtyme a castel, al of lym and stoon;	Sometimes a castle, all of mortar and stone;
And whan hem lyked, voyded it anon.	And when they pleased, they made it suddenly disappear.
Thus semed it to every mannes sighte.	Thus it seemed to every man's sight.
"Now thanne conclude I thus: that if I myghte	"Now then conclude I thus: that if I might
At Orliens som oold felawe yfynde	At Orleans find some old fellow
That hadde thise moones mansions in mynde,	Who had these moon's stations in mind,
Or oother magyk natureel above,	Or other natural science beyond that
He sholde wel make my brother han his love.	He should well make my brother have his love.
For with an apparence a clerk may make,	For with an apparition a clerk may make it seem,
To mannes sighte, that alle the rokkes blake	To man's sight, that all the rocks black
Of Britaigne weren yvoyded everichon,	Of Brittany were removed every one,
And shippes by the brynke comen and gon,	And ships by the shore come and go,
And in swich forme enduren a wowke or two.	And in such form endure a week or two.
Thanne were my brother warisshed of his wo;	Then my brother would be cured of his woe;
Thanne moste she nedes holden hire biheste,	Then must she by necessity keep her promise,
Or elles he shal shame hire atte leeste."	Or else he shall shame her at the least."
What sholde I make a lenger tale of this?	Why should I make a longer tale of this?
Unto his brotheres bed he comen is,	Unto his brother's bed he is come,
And swich confort he yaf hym for to gon	And such encouragement he gave him to go
To Orliens that he up stirte anon,	To Orleans that he leaped up immediately,
And on his wey forthward thanne is he fare	And on his way forth then is he gone
In hope for to been lissed of his care.	In hope to be relieved of his care.

Of pured gold a thousand pound of wighte	Of refined gold a thousand pounds of weight

And that she levere had lost that day hir lyf,	And that she would rather have lost her life that day,

And ther they setten stevene for to meete,	And there they agreed on a time to meet,
To pleyen at the dys in swich a streete.	To play at dice in such and such a street.
For in the toune nas ther no prentys	For in the town there was no apprentice
That fairer koude caste a paire of dys	That could better throw a pair of dice
Than Perkyn koude, and therto he was free	Than Perkin could, and thereto he was free
Of his dispense, in place of pryvetee.	In his spending, in a private place.
That fond his maister wel in his chaffare,	That found his master easily in his business accounts,
For often tyme he foond his box ful bare.	For many times he found his cash box completely bare.
For sikerly a prentys revelour	For surely (in the case of) an revelling apprentice
That haunteth dys, riot, or paramour,	Who makes a practice of dicing, debauchery, or womanizing,
His maister shal it in his shoppe abye,	His master shall pay for it in his shop,
Al have he no part of the mynstralcye.	Even though he has no share of the entertainment (for which he pays).
For thefte and riot, they been convertible,	For theft and debauchery, they are interchangeable.
Al konne he pleye on gyterne or ribible.	Even though he knows how to play on guitar or fiddle.
Revel and trouthe, as in a lowe degree,	Revelling and honesty, in one of low degree,
They been ful wrothe al day, as men may see.	Are always incompatible, as anyone can see.
This joly prentys with his maister bood,	This jolly apprentice with his master remained,
Til he were ny out of his prentishood,	Until he was nearly out of his apprenticeship,
Al were he snybbed bothe erly and late,	Although he was rebuked both early and late,
And somtyme lad with revel to Newegate.	And sometimes taken (as a prisoner) with music to Newgate prison.
But atte laste his maister hym bithoghte,	But at the last his master remembered,
Upon a day, whan he his papir soghte,	Upon a day, when Perkin sought his certificate of release,
Of a proverbe that seith this same word:	A proverb that says this same word:
"Wel bet is roten appul out of hoord	"Well better is a rotten apple out of the store
Than that it rotie al the remenaunt."	Than that it rot al the remnant."
So fareth it by a riotous servaunt;	So fares it with a debauched servant;
It is ful lasse harm to lete hym pace,	It is much less harm to let him go away,
Than he shende alle the servantz in the place.	Than that he should ruin all the servants in the place.
Therfore his maister yaf hym acquitance,	Therefore his master gave him his certificate,
And bad hym go, with sorwe and with meschance!	And ordered him to go, with sorrow and with bad luck!
And thus this joly prentys hadde his leve.	And thus this jolly apprentice had his leave.
Now lat hym riote al the nyght or leve.	Now let him revel all the night or leave off (do as he chooses).
And for ther is no theef withoute a lowke,	And because there is no thief without an accomplice,
That helpeth hym to wasten and to sowke	Who helps him to waste and to consume
Of that he brybe kan or borwe may,	That which he can steal or may borrow,
Anon he sente his bed and his array	Right away he sent his bed and his clothing
Unto a compeer of his owene sort,	Unto a companion of his own sort,
That lovede dys, and revel, and disport,	Who loved dicing, and revelling, and having fun,
And hadde a wyf that heeld for contenance	And had a wife that kept for the sake of appearances
A shoppe, and swyved for hir sustenance.	A shop, and screwed for her living.
Here folweth the Prologe of the Maunciples Tale.	Here follows the prologue of the Maniciple's Tale.
Woot ye nat where ther stant a litel toun	Know you not where there stands a little town
Which that ycleped is Bobbe-up-and-doun,	Which is called Bobbe-up-and-down,
Under the Blee, in Caunterbury Weye?	Under the Blee, in Canterbury Way?
Ther gan oure Hooste for to jape and pleye,	There began our Host to joke and play,
And seyde, "Sires, what! Dun is in the myre!	And said, "Sirs, what! Dun is in the mire!
Is ther no man, for preyere ne for hyre,	Is there no man, for prayer nor for hire,
That wole awake oure felawe al bihynde?	That will awake our fellow far behind us?
A theef myghte hym ful lightly robbe and bynde.	A thief might full easily rob and bind him.
See how he nappeth! See how, for cokkes bones,	See how he naps! See how, for cock's bones,
That he wol falle fro his hors atones!	That he will soon fall from his horse!
Is that a cook of Londoun, with meschaunce?	Is that a cook of London, with bad luck (to him)?
Do hym come forth, he knoweth his penaunce;	Make him come forth, he knows his penance;
For he shal telle a tale, by my fey,	For he shall tell a tale, by my faith,
Although it be nat worth a botel hey.	Although it be not worth a bundle of hay.
Awake, thou Cook," quod he, "God yeve thee sorwe!	Awake, thou Cook," said he, "God give thee sorrow!
What eyleth thee to slepe by the morwe?	What ails thee to sleep in the morning?
Hastow had fleen al nyght, or artow dronke?	Hast thou had fleas all night, or art thou drunk?
Or hastow with som quene al nyght yswonke,	Or hast thou with some prostitute all night labored,
So that thow mayst nat holden up thyn heed?"	So that thou can not hold up thy head?"
This Cook, that was ful pale and no thyng reed,	This Cook, who was full pale and not at all red,
Seyde to oure Hoost, "So God my soule blesse,	Said to our Host, "God bless my soul,
As ther is falle on me swich hevynesse,	There is fallen on me such heaviness,
Noot I nat why, that me were levere slepe	Know I not why, that I would rather sleep
Than the beste galon wyn in Chepe."	Than (have) the best gallon of wine in Cheapside."
"Wel," quod the Maunciple, "if it may doon ese	"Well," said the Manciple, "if it may give relief
To thee, sire Cook, and to no wight displese,	To thee, sir Cook, and be displeasing to no person,
Which that heere rideth in this compaignye,	Who rides here in this company,
And that oure Hoost wole, of his curteisye,	And (providing) that our Host would (agree), of his courtesy,
I wol as now excuse thee of thy tale.	I will for now excuse thee of thy tale.
For, in good feith, thy visage is ful pale,	For, in good faith, thy visage is full pale,
Thyne eyen daswen eek, as that me thynketh,	Thy eyes are dazed also, as it seems to me,
And, wel I woot, thy breeth ful soure stynketh:	And, well I know, thy breath full sourly stinks:
That sheweth wel thou art nat wel disposed.	That shows well thou art not in good health.
Of me, certeyn, thou shalt nat been yglosed.	By me, certainly, thou shalt not be deceived.
See how he ganeth, lo, this dronken wight,	See how he yawns, lo, this drunken fellow,
As though he wolde swolwe us anonright.	As though he would swallow us right away.
Hoold cloos thy mouth, man, by thy fader kyn!	Keep thy mouth closed, man, by thy father's kin!
The devel of helle sette his foot therin!	The devil of hell set his foot therein!
Thy cursed breeth infecte wole us alle.	Thy cursed breath would infect us all.
Fy, stynkyng swyn! Fy, foule moote thee falle!	Fie, stinking swine! Fie, may foul fortune thee befall!
A, taketh heede, sires, of this lusty man.	Ah, take heed, sirs, of this lusty man.
Now, sweete sire, wol ye justen atte fan?	Now, sweet sir, will you joust at the quintain?
Therto me thynketh ye been wel yshape!	It seems to me you are in good shape for that!
I trowe that ye dronken han wyn ape,	I believe that you have drunk until you act like an ape,
And that is whan men pleyen with a straw."	And that is when men play with a straw."
And with this speche the Cook wax wrooth and wraw,	And with this speech the Cook became angry and enraged,
And on the Manciple he gan nodde faste	And on the Manciple he began to shake his head fast
For lakke of speche, and doun the hors hym caste,	For lack of speech, and down the horse him threw,
Where as he lay, til that men hym up took.	Where he lay, until men lifted him up.
This was a fair chyvachee of a cook!	This was a fine feat of horsemanship by a cook!
Allas, he nadde holde hym by his ladel!	Alas, he had not kept himself by his ladle (i.e., stayed home)!
And er that he agayn were in his sadel,	And before he was again in his saddle,
Ther was greet showvyng bothe to and fro	There was great shoving both to and fro
To lifte hym up, and muchel care and wo,	To lift him up, and much care and woe,
So unweeldy was this sory palled goost.	So unwieldy was this sorry enfeebled soul.
And to the Manciple thanne spak oure Hoost:	And to the Manciple then spoke our Host:
"By cause drynke hath dominacioun	"Because drink has domination
Upon this man, by my savacioun,	Upon this man, by my salvation,
I trowe he lewedly wolde telle his tale.	I believe he would tell his tale badly.
For, were it wyn or oold or moysty ale	For, were it wine or old or new ale
That he hath dronke, he speketh in his nose,	That he has drunk, he speaks in his nose,
And fneseth faste, and eek he hath the pose.	And sneezes fast, and also he has a head cold.
"He hath also to do moore than ynough	"He has also more than enough to do
To kepen hym and his capul out of the slough;	To keep him and his horse out of the mud;
And if he falle from his capul eftsoone,	And if he fall from his horse again,
Thanne shal we alle have ynogh to doone	Then shall we all have enough to do
In liftyng up his hevy dronken cors.	In lifting up his heavy drunken body.
Telle on thy tale; of hym make I no fors.	Tell on thy tale; of him I take no account.
"But yet, Manciple, in feith thou art to nyce,	"But yet, Manciple, in faith thou art too foolish,
Thus openly repreve hym of his vice.	Thus openly to reprove him of his vice.
Another day he wole, peraventure,	Another day he would, perhaps,
Reclayme thee and brynge thee to lure;	Recall thee and bring thee to the lure (like a hawk);
I meene, he speke wole of smale thynges,	I mean, he would speak of small things,
As for to pynchen at thy rekenynges,	As for to find fault with thy accounts,
That were nat honest, if it cam to preef."	That may not be honest, if it comes to proof."
"No," quod the Manciple, "that were a greet mescheef!	"No," said the Manciple, "that would be a great mischief!
So myghte he lightly brynge me in the snare.	In that way he could easily bring me into the trap.
Yet hadde I levere payen for the mare	Yet I would rather pay for the mare
Which he rit on, than he sholde with me stryve.	That he rides on, than he should strive with me.
I wol nat wratthen hym, also moot I thryve!	I will not anger him, as I may thrive!
That that I spak, I seyde it in my bourde.	That which I spoke, I said it in my joking.
And wite ye what? I have heer in a gourde	And do you know what? I have here in a gourd
A draghte of wyn, ye, of a ripe grape,	A draught of wine, yes, of a ripe grape,
And right anon ye shul seen a good jape.	And right away you shall see a good joke.
This Cook shal drynke therof, if I may.	This Cook shall drink thereof, if I may.
Up peyne of deeth, he wol nat seye me nay."	Upon pain of death, he will not say me nay."
And certeynly, to tellen as it was,	And certainly, to tell it as it was,
Of this vessel the Cook drank faste, allas!	Of this vessel the Cook drank fast, alas!
What neded hym? He drank ynough biforn.	Why did he need that? He drank enough before.
And whan he hadde pouped in this horn,	And when he had blown in this horn,
To the Manciple he took the gourde agayn;	To the Manciple he gave the gourd again;
And of that drynke the Cook was wonder fayn,	And of that drink the Cook was wonderfully pleased,
And thanked hym in swich wise as he koude.	And thanked him in such a way as he could.
Thanne gan oure Hoost to laughen wonder loude,	Then began our Host to laugh wonderfully loud,
And seyde, "I se wel it is necessarie,	And said, "I see well it is necessary,
Where that we goon, good drynke with us carie;	Wherever we go, to carry good drink with us;
For that wol turne rancour and disese	For that will turn rancor and strife
T' acord and love, and many a wrong apese.	To accord and love, and appease many a wrong.
"O Bacus, yblessed be thy name,	"O Bacchus, blessed be thy name,
That so kanst turnen ernest into game!	Who so can turn earnest into game!
Worshipe and thank be to thy deitee!	Worship and thanks be to thy deity!
Of that mateere ye gete namoore of me.	Of that matter you get no more of me.
Telle on thy tale, Manciple, I thee preye."	Tell on thy tale, Manciple, I thee pray."
"Wel, sire," quod he, "now herkneth what I seye."	"Well, sir," said he, "now hearken what I say."
Heere bigynneth the Maunciples Tale of the Crowe.	Here begins the Manciple's Tale of the Crow.
Whan Phebus dwelled heere in this erthe adoun,	When Phoebus dwelled down here in this earth,
As olde bookes maken mencioun,	As old books make mention,
He was the mooste lusty bachiler	He was the most lusty bachelor
In al this world, and eek the beste archer.	In all this world, and also the best archer.
He slow Phitoun, the serpent, as he lay	He slew Phitoun, the serpent, as he lay
Slepynge agayn the sonne upon a day;	Sleeping in the sun upon a day;
And many another noble worthy dede	And many another noble worthy deed
He with his bowe wroghte, as men may rede.	He wrought with his bow, as men may read.
Pleyen he koude on every mynstralcie,	He could play on every minstrelsy,
And syngen that it was a melodie	And sing so that it was a pleasure
To heeren of his cleere voys the soun.	To hear of his clear voice the sound.
Certes the kyng of Thebes, Amphioun,	Certainly the king of Thebes, Amphioun,
That with his syngyng walled that citee,	Who with his singing walled that city,
Koude nevere syngen half so wel as hee.	Could never sing half so well as he.
Therto he was the semelieste man	Thereto he was the best looking man
That is or was sith that the world bigan.	That is or was since the world began.
What nedeth it his fetures to discryve?	What needs it his features to describe?
For in this world was noon so faire on-lyve.	For in this world was no one so handsome alive.
He was therwith fulfild of gentillesse,	He was therewith filled full of nobility,
Of honour, and of parfit worthynesse.	Of honor, and of perfect worthiness.
This Phebus, that was flour of bachilrie,	This Phoebus, which was the flower of knighthood,
As wel in fredom as in chivalrie,	As well in generosity as in chivalry,
For his desport, in signe eek of victorie	For his amusement, in sign also of victory
Of Phitoun, so as telleth us the storie,	Over Phitoun, as tells us the story,
Was wont to beren in his hand a bowe.	Was accustomed to bear in his hand a bow.
Now hadde this Phebus in his hous a crowe	Now had this Phoebus in his house a crow
Which in a cage he fostred many a day,	Which in a cage he fostered many a day,
And taughte it speken, as men teche a jay.	And taught it to speak, as men teach a jay.
Whit was this crowe as is a snow-whit swan,	White was this crow as is a snow-white swan,
And countrefete the speche of every man	And imitate the speech of every man
He koude, whan he sholde telle a tale.	He could, when he should tell a tale.
Therwith in al this world no nyghtyngale	Therewith in all this world no nightingale
Ne koude, by an hondred thousand deel,	Could not, by a hundred thousand times,
Syngen so wonder myrily and weel.	Sing so wonderfully merrily and well.
Now hadde this Phebus in his hous a wyf	Now had this Phoebus in his house a woman
Which that he lovede moore than his lyf,	Whom he loved more than his life,
And nyght and day dide evere his diligence	And night and day did ever his efforts
Hir for to plese and doon hire reverence,	To please her and do her reverence,
Save oonly, if the sothe that I shal sayn,	Save only, if I shall say the truth,
Jalous he was, and wolde have kept hire fayn.	Jealous he was, and would eagerly have kept her.
For hym were looth byjaped for to be,	For he was loath to be tricked,
And so is every wight in swich degree;	And so is every person in such a situation;
But al in ydel, for it availleth noght.	But all in vain, for it does not help.
A good wyf, that is clene of werk and thoght,	A good wife, who is clean of deed and thought,
Sholde nat been kept in noon awayt, certayn;	Should not be constantly watched, certainly;
And trewely the labour is in vayn	And truly the labor is in vain
To kepe a shrewe, for it wol nat bee.	To keep a shrew, for it will not be.
This holde I for a verray nycetee,	This hold I for a real act of folly,
To spille labour for to kepe wyves:	To waste labor guarding wives:
Thus writen olde clerkes in hir lyves.	Thus wrote old clerks in their time.
But now to purpos, as I first bigan:	But now to purpose, as I first began:
This worthy Phebus dooth al that he kan	This worthy Phoebus does all that he can
To plesen hire, wenynge for swich plesaunce,	To please her, supposing for such pleasing actions,
And for his manhede and his governaunce,	And for his manly qualities and his behavior,
That no man sholde han put hym from hir grace.	That no man should have put him out of her grace.
But God it woot, ther may no man embrace	But God knows it, there can no man embrace
As to destreyne a thyng which that nature	And restrain a thing which nature
Hath natureelly set in a creature.	Has naturally set in a creature.
Taak any bryd, and put it in a cage,	Take any bird, and put it in a cage,
And do al thyn entente and thy corage	And give all thy attention and take thy pains
To fostre it tendrely with mete and drynke	To foster it tenderly with food and drink
Of alle deyntees that thou kanst bithynke,	Of all dainties that thou can imagine,
And keep it al so clenly as thou may,	And keep it as cleanly as thou can,
Although his cage of gold be never so gay,	Although his cage of gold be never so gay,
Yet hath this brid, by twenty thousand foold,	Yet would this bird, by twenty thousand times,
Levere in a forest that is rude and coold	Rather in a forest that is rude and cold
Goon ete wormes and swich wrecchednesse.	Go eat worms and such wretched food.
For evere this brid wol doon his bisynesse	For ever this bird will work diligently
To escape out of his cage, yif he may.	To escape out of his cage, if he can.
His libertee this brid desireth ay.	His liberty this bird desires always.
Lat take a cat, and fostre hym wel with milk	Let's take a cat, and foster him well with milk
And tendre flessh, and make his couche of silk,	And tender meat, and make his couch of silk,
And lat hym seen a mous go by the wal,	And let him see a mouse go by the wall,
Anon he weyveth milk and flessh and al,	Right then he refuses milk and meat and all,
And every deyntee that is in that hous,	And every dainty that is in that house,
Swich appetit hath he to ete a mous.	Such appetite has he to eat a mouse.
Lo, heere hath lust his dominacioun,	Lo, here has lust his domination,
And appetit fleemeth discrecioun.	And appetite drives away discretion.
A she-wolf hath also a vileyns kynde.	A she-wolf has also an evil nature.
The lewedeste wolf that she may fynde,	The most crude wolf that she can find,
Or leest of reputacioun, wol she take,	Or least of reputation, will she take,
In tyme whan hir lust to han a make.	In time when she lusts to have a mate.
Alle thise ensamples speke I by thise men	All these examples I about speak these men
That been untrewe, and nothyng by wommen.	That are untrue, and nothing about women.
For men han evere a likerous appetit	For men have ever a lecherous appetite
On lower thyng to parfourne hire delit	On lower things to perform their delight
Than on hire wyves, be they never so faire,	Than on their wives, be they never so fair,
Ne never so trewe, ne so debonaire.	Nor never so true, nor so gracious.
Flessh is so newefangel, with meschaunce,	Flesh is so fond of novelty, curses on it,
That we ne konne in nothyng han plesaunce	That we can not take pleasure in anything
That sowneth into vertu any while.	That is consonant with virtue for any length of time.
This Phebus, which that thoghte upon no gile,	This Phoebus, who thought upon no guile,
Deceyved was, for al his jolitee.	Deceived was, despite all his attractive qualities.
For under hym another hadde shee,	For under him another had she,
A man of litel reputacioun,	A man of little reputation,
Nat worth to Phebus in comparisoun.	Worth nothing in comparison to Phoebus.
The moore harm is, it happeth ofte so,	The more harm is, it happens often so,
Of which ther cometh muchel harm and wo.	Of which there comes much harm and woe.
And so bifel, whan Phebus was absent,	And so befell, when Phoebus was absent,
His wyf anon hath for hir lemman sent.	His wife immediately has for her sweetheart sent.
Hir lemman? Certes, this is a knavyssh speche!	Her sweetheart? Certes, this is a knavish speech!
Foryeveth it me, and that I yow biseche.	Forgive it me, and that I you beseech.
The wise Plato seith, as ye may rede,	The wise Plato says, as you may read,
The word moot nede accorde with the dede.	The word must by necessity accord with the deed.
If men shal telle proprely a thyng,	If men shall tell a thing properly,
The word moot cosyn be to the werkyng.	The word must be cousin to the deed.
I am a boystous man, right thus seye I:	I am an unlearned man, right thus say I:
Ther nys no difference, trewely,	There is no difference, truly,
Bitwixe a wyf that is of heigh degree,	Between a wife that is of high degree,
If of hir body dishonest she bee,	If of her body dishonest she bee,
And a povre wenche, oother than this --	And a poor wench, other than this --
If it so be they werke bothe amys --	If it so be they work both amiss --
But that the gentile, in estaat above,	Except that the gentle, higher in rank,
She shal be cleped his lady, as in love;	She shall be called his lady, as in love;
And for that oother is a povre womman,	And because that other is a poor woman,
She shal be cleped his wenche or his lemman.	She shall be called his wench or his sweetie.
And, God it woot, myn owene deere brother,	And, God it knows, my own dear brother,
Men leyn that oon as lowe as lith that oother.	Men lay that one as low as lies that other.
Right so bitwixe a titlelees tiraunt	Right so between an usurping tyrant
And an outlawe or a theef erraunt,	And an outlaw or an arrant thief,
The same I seye: ther is no difference.	The same I say: there is no difference.
To Alisaundre was toold this sentence,	To Alexander was told this sentence,
That, for the tirant is of gretter myght	That, because the tyrant is of greater might
By force of meynee for to sleen dounright,	By the size of his army to slay downright,
And brennen hous and hoom, and make al playn,	And burn house and home, and level everything,
Lo, therfore is he cleped a capitayn;	Lo, therefore is he called a captain;
And for the outlawe hath but smal meynee,	And because the outlaw has but a small group of followers,
And may nat doon so greet an harm as he,	And can not do as much harm as he,
Ne brynge a contree to so greet mescheef,	Nor bring a country to such great mischief,
Men clepen hym an outlawe or a theef.	Men call him an outlaw or a thief.
But for I am a man noght textueel,	But because I am not a learned man,
I wol noght telle of textes never a deel;	I will tell nothing of texts, never a bit;
I wol go to my tale, as I bigan.	I will go to my tale, as I began.
Whan Phebus wyf had sent for hir lemman,	When Phoebus wife had sent for her leman,
Anon they wroghten al hire lust volage.	Right away they satisfied all their reckless lust.
The white crowe, that heeng ay in the cage,	The white crow, that hanged always in the cage,
Biheeld hire werk, and seyde never a word.	Beheld their work, and said never a word.
And whan that hoom was come Phebus, the lord,	And when home was come Phoebus, the lord,
This crowe sang "Cokkow! Cokkow! Cokkow!"	This crow sang "Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!"
"What, bryd?" quod Phebus. "What song syngestow?	"What, bird?" said Phoebus. "What song singest thou?
Ne were thow wont so myrily to synge	Were thou not accustomed so merrily to sing
That to myn herte it was a rejoysynge	That to my heart it was a rejoicing
To heere thy voys? Allas, what song is this?"	To hear thy voice? Alas, what song is this?"
"By God," quod he, "I synge nat amys.	"By God," said he, "I sing not amiss.
Phebus," quod he, "for al thy worthynesse,	Phoebus," said he, "for all thy worthiness,
For al thy beautee and thy gentilesse,	For all thy beauty and thy nobility,
For al thy song and al thy mynstralcye,	For all thy song and all thy music,
For al thy waityng, blered is thyn ye	For all thy watching, thou hast been tricked
With oon of litel reputacioun,	By one of little reputation,
Noght worth to thee, as in comparisoun,	Not worth, compared to thee,
The montance of a gnat, so moote I thryve!	The value of a gnat, as I may thrive!
For on thy bed thy wyf I saugh hym swyve."	For on thy bed I saw him copulate with thy wife."
What wol ye moore? The crowe anon hym tolde,	What more do you want? The crow immediately him told,
By sadde tokenes and by wordes bolde,	By clear evidence and by bold words,
How that his wyf had doon hire lecherye,	How his wife had done her lechery,
Hym to greet shame and to greet vileynye,	To his great shame and to his great dishonor,
And tolde hym ofte he saugh it with his yen.	And told him repeatedly he saw it with his eyes.
This Phebus gan aweyward for to wryen,	This Phoebus began to turn away,
And thoughte his sorweful herte brast atwo.	And thought his sorrowful heart would break in two.
His bowe he bente, and sette therinne a flo,	His bow he bent, and set therein an arrow,
And in his ire his wyf thanne hath he slayn.	And in his ire his wife then has he slain.
This is th' effect; ther is namoore to sayn;	This is the substance of it; there is no more to say;
For sorwe of which he brak his mynstralcie,	For sorrow of which he broke his musical instruments,
Bothe harpe, and lute, and gyterne, and sautrie;	Both harp, and lute, and cither, and psaltery;
And eek he brak his arwes and his bowe,	And also he broke his arrows and his bow,
And after that thus spak he to the crowe:	And after that thus spoke he to the crow:
"Traitour," quod he, "with tonge of scorpioun,	"Traitor," said he, "with tongue of scorpion,
Thou hast me broght to my confusioun;	Thou hast me brought to my ruin;
Allas, that I was wroght! Why nere I deed?	Alas, that I was wrought! Why was I not dead?
O deere wyf! O gemme of lustiheed!	O dear wife! O gem of delight!
That were to me so sad and eek so trewe,	Who were to me so stable and also so true,
Now listow deed, with face pale of hewe,	Now liest thou dead, with face pale of hue,

My sone, God of his endelees goodnesse	My son, God of his endless goodness
Walled a tonge with teeth and lippes eke,	Walled a tongue with teeth and lips also,

He may by no wey clepe his word agayn.	He can by no way call his word back.
Thyng that is seyd is seyd, and forth it gooth,	Thing that is said is said, and forth it goes,
Though hym repente, or be hym nevere so looth.	Though he repent, or be ever so unwilling (it be known).

A doghter hath that, syn the world bigan,	A daughter has that, since the world began,

Can he oght telle a myrie tale or tweye,	Can he in any way tell a merry tale or two,
With which he glade may this compaignye?"	With which he may gladden this company?"

He kan of murthe and eek of jolitee	He knows about mirth and also about jollity

He koude werke, and that in sondry wise.	He knows how to work, and that in a variety of ways.

As hoomly as he rit amonges yow,	Despite how modestly he rides amongst you,
If ye hym knewe, it wolde be for youre prow.	If you knew him, it would be to your advantage.
Ye wolde nat forgoon his aqueyntaunce	You would not forgo his acquaintance
For muchel good, I dar leye in balaunce	For great riches, I dare wager on that
Al that I have in my possessioun.	All that I have in my possession.
He is a man of heigh discrecioun;	He is a man of great discretion;
I warne yow wel, he is a passyng man."	I tell you indeed, he is a remarkable man."
"Wel," quod oure Hoost, "I pray thee, tel me than,	"Well," said our Host, "I pray thee, tell me then,
Is he a clerk, or noon? Telle what he is."	Is he a clerk, or not? Tell what he is."
"Nay, he is gretter than a clerk, ywis,"	"Nay, he is greater than a clerk, indeed,"
Seyde this Yeman, "and in wordes fewe,	Said this Yeoman, "and in few words,
Hoost, of his craft somwhat I wol yow shewe.	Host, I will show you something of his craft.
"I seye, my lord kan swich subtilitee --	"I say, my lord knows such esoteric science --
But al his craft ye may nat wite at me,	But all his craft you can not know from me,
And somwhat helpe I yet to his wirkyng --	And yet somewhat I help in his work --

And pave it al of silver and of gold."	And pave it all with silver and with gold."
And whan this Yeman hadde this tale ytold	And when this Yeoman had this tale told
Unto oure Hoost, he seyde, "Benedicitee!	Unto our Host, he said, "Bless you!
This thyng is wonder merveillous to me,	This thing is wonderfully marvelous to me,
Syn that thy lord is of so heigh prudence,	Since thy lord is of such great prudence,
By cause of which men sholde hym reverence,	Because of which men should reverence him,
That of his worshipe rekketh he so lite.	That he cares so little for his own self-respect.
His overslope nys nat worth a myte,	His outer garment is not worth a fraction of a penny,
As in effect, to hym, so moot I go,	Because in fact, to him, as I may go (I swear),
It is al baudy and totore also.	It is all dirty and tattered also.
Why is thy lord so sluttissh, I the preye,	Why is thy lord so slovenly, I pray thee,
And is of power bettre clooth to beye,	And has the power to buy better cloth,
If that his dede accorde with thy speche?	If his deeds accord with thy speech?
Telle me that, and that I thee biseche."	Tell me that, and of that I beseech thee."
"Why?" quod this Yeman, "wherto axe ye me?	"Why?" said this Yeoman, "why do you ask me?
God help me so, for he shal nevere thee!	So help me God, for he shall never prosper!
(But I wol nat avowe that I seye,	(But I will not publicly acknowledge what I say,
And therfore keepe it secree, I yow preye.)	And therefore keep it secret, I pray you.)
He is to wys, in feith, as I bileeve.	He is too wise, in faith, as I believe.
That that is overdoon, it wol nat preeve	That which is done too much, it will not turn out
Aright, as clerkes seyn; it is a vice.	Right, as clerks say; it is a vice.
Wherfore in that I holde hym lewed and nyce.	Therefore in that I hold him ignorant and foolish.
For whan a man hath over-greet a wit,	For when a man has too great a wit,
Ful oft hym happeth to mysusen it.	Very often he happens to misuse it.
So dooth my lord, and that me greveth soore;	So does my lord, and that sorely grieves me;
God it amende! I kan sey yow namoore."	God amend it! I can tell you no more."
"Ther-of no fors, good Yeman," quod oure Hoost;	"That does not matter, good Yeoman," said our Host;
"Syn of the konnyng of thy lord thow woost,	"Since thou knowest of the cunning of thy lord,
Telle how he dooth, I pray thee hertely,	Tell how he does, I pray thee heartily,
Syn that he is so crafty and so sly.	Since he is so crafty and so sly.
Where dwelle ye, if it to telle be?"	Where do you dwell, if it can be told?"
"In the suburbes of a toun," quod he,	"In the outskirts of a town," said he,

Whereas thise robbours and thise theves by kynde	Where these robbers and these thieves by nature
Holden hir pryvee fereful residence,	Hold their private fearful residence,
As they that dar nat shewen hir presence;	Like those who dare not show their presence;
So faren we, if I shal seye the sothe."	So fare we, if I shall say the truth."
"Now," quod oure Hoost, "yit lat me talke to the.	"Now," said our Host, "yet let me talk to thee.
Why artow so discoloured of thy face?"	Why art thou so discolored in thy face?"
"Peter!" quod he, "God yeve it harde grace,	"Peter!" said he, "God give it bad luck,
I am so used in the fyr to blowe	I am so used to blow in the fire
That it hath chaunged my colour, I trowe.	That it has changed my color, I believe.
I am nat wont in no mirour to prie,	I am not accustomed to peer in any mirror,
But swynke soore and lerne multiplie.	But to work hard and to learn to transmute metals.
We blondren evere and pouren in the fir,	We blunder ever and stare in the fire,
And for al that we faille of oure desir,	And despite all that, we fail to achieve our desire,
For evere we lakken oure conclusioun.	For ever we lack our desired conclusion.
To muchel folk we doon illusioun,	To many folk we do delusion,
And borwe gold, be it a pound or two,	And borrow gold, be it a pound or two,
Or ten, or twelve, or manye sommes mo,	Or ten, or twelve, or many greater sums,
And make hem wenen, at the leeste weye,	And make them believe, at the very least,
That of a pound we koude make tweye.	That of one pound we could make two.
Yet is it fals, but ay we han good hope	Yet is it false, but always we have good hope
It for to doon, and after it we grope.	To do it, and after it we grope.
But that science is so fer us biforn,	But that knowledge is so far ahead of us,
We mowen nat, although we hadden it sworn,	We can not, although we had sworn it,
It overtake, it slit awey so faste.	Overtake it, it slides away so fast.
It wole us maken beggers atte laste."	It will make us beggars at the last."
Whil this Yeman was thus in his talkyng,	While this Yeoman was thus in his talking,
This Chanoun drough hym neer and herde al thyng	This Canon drew himself nearer and heard every thing
Which this Yeman spak, for suspecioun	Which this Yeoman spoke, for suspicion
Of mennes speche evere hadde this Chanoun.	Of men's speech ever had this Canon.
For Catoun seith that he that gilty is	For Cato says that he who is guilty
Demeth alle thyng be spoke of hym, ywis.	Believes every thing is spoken about him, indeed.
That was the cause he gan so ny hym drawe	That was the cause he did draw himself so near
To his Yeman, to herknen al his sawe.	To his Yeoman, to hear all his speech.
And thus he seyde unto his Yeman tho:	And thus he said unto his Yeoman then:
"Hoold thou thy pees and spek no wordes mo,	"Hold thou thy peace and speak no more words,
For if thou do, thou shalt it deere abye.	For if thou do, thou shalt dearly pay for it.
Thou sclaundrest me heere in this compaignye,	Thou slanderest me here in this company,
And eek discoverest that thou sholdest hyde."	And also revealest what thou shouldest hide."
"Ye," quod oure Hoost, "telle on, what so bityde.	"Yes," said our Host, "tell on, whataever may happen.
Of al his thretyng rekke nat a myte!"	Reckon all his threatening not worth a fraction of a penny!"
"In feith," quod he, "namoore I do but lyte."	"In faith," said he, "I do (reckon him) but little any more."
And whan this Chanon saugh it wolde nat bee,	And when this Canon saw it would not be,
But his Yeman wolde telle his pryvetee,	But that his Yeoman would tell his secrets,
He fledde awey for verray sorwe and shame.	He fled away for true sorrow and shame.
"A!" quod the Yeman, "heere shal arise game;	"Ah!" said the Yeoman, "here shall arise some amusement;
Al that I kan anon now wol I telle.	Right now I will tell all that I know.
Syn he is goon, the foule feend hym quelle!	Since he is gone, may the foul fiend kill him!
For nevere heerafter wol I with hym meete	For never hereafter will I meet with him
For peny ne for pound, I yow biheete.	For penny nor for pound, I promise you.
He that me broghte first unto that game,	He who brought me first unto that game,
Er that he dye, sorwe have he and shame!	Before he dies, may he have sorrow and shame!
For it is ernest to me, by my feith;	For it is serious (not game) to me, by my faith;
That feele I wel, what so any man seith.	That feel I well, whatever any man says.
And yet, for al my smert and al my grief,	And yet, for all my pain and all my grief,
For al my sorwe, labour, and meschief,	For all my sorrow, labor, and mischief,
I koude nevere leve it in no wise.	I could never leave it in any way.
Now wolde God my wit myghte suffise	Now I wish to God my wit might suffice
To tellen al that longeth to that art!	To tell all that belongs to that art!
But nathelees yow wol I tellen part.	But nonetheless you desire that I tell part.
Syn that my lord is goon, I wol nat spare;	Since my lord is gone, I will not spare;
Swich thyng as that I knowe, I wol declare.	Such things as what I know, I will declare.

And somme are scatered al the floor aboute;	And some are scattered all over the floor;
Somme lepe into the roof. Withouten doute,	Some leap into the roof. Without doubt,
Though that the feend noght in oure sighte hym shewe,	Though the fiend does not show himself to our sight,
I trowe he with us be, that ilke shrewe!	I believe he is with us, that same scoundrel!
In helle, where that he is lord and sire,	In hell, where he is lord and sire,
Nis ther moore wo, ne moore rancour ne ire.	There is no greater woe, nor greater rancor nor ire.
Whan that oure pot is broke, as I have sayd,	When our pot is broken, as I have said,
Every man chit and halt hym yvele apayd.	Every man chides and considers himsef ill used.
Somme seyde it was long on the fir makyng;	Some said it was due to the making of the fire;
Somme seyde nay, it was on the blowyng --	Some said nay, it was due to the blowing --
Thanne was I fered, for that was myn office.	Then was I afraid, for that was my job.
"Straw!" quod the thridde, "ye been lewed and nyce.	"Rubbish!" said the third, "you are ignorant and foolish.
It was nat tempred as it oghte be."	It was not tempered as it ought to be."
"Nay," quod the fourthe, "stynt and herkne me.	"Nay," said the fourth, "be quiet and listen to me.
By cause oure fir ne was nat maad of beech,	Because our fire was not made of beech,
That is the cause and oother noon, so thee'ch!"	That is the cause and none other, as I may prosper!"
I kan nat telle wheron it was long,	I can not tell what it was due to,
But wel I woot greet strif is us among.	But well I know great strife is among us.
"What," quod my lord, "ther is namoore to doone;	"Well," said my lord, "there is no more to do;
Of thise perils I wol be war eftsoone.	Of these perils I will be wary next time.
I am right siker that the pot was crased.	I am very sure that the pot was cracked.
Be as be may, be ye no thyng amased;	Be as be may, be you in no way amazed;
As usage is, lat swepe the floor as swithe,	As our practice is, have the floor quickly swept,
Plukke up youre hertes and beeth glad and blithe."	Pluck up your hearts and be glad and blithe."
The mullok on an heep ysweped was,	The rubbish was swept in a heap,
And on the floor ycast a canevas,	And on the floor was cast a canvas,
And al this mullok in a syve ythrowe,	And all this rubbish thrown in a sieve
And sifted, and ypiked many a throwe.	And sifted, and picked over many a time.
"Pardee," quod oon, "somwhat of oure metal	"By God," said one, "something of our metal
Yet is ther heere, though that we han nat al.	Yet is there here, though we have not all.
And though this thyng myshapped have as now,	And though this thing may have turned out badly this time,
Another tyme it may be well ynow.	Another time it may go well indeed.

A marchant, pardee, may nat ay endure,	A merchant, by God, may not endure forever,
Trusteth me wel, in his prosperitee.	Trust me well, in his prosperity.
Somtyme his good is drowned in the see,	Sometimes his goods are drowned in the sea,
And somtyme comth it sauf unto the londe."	And sometime they come safely unto the land."
"Pees!" quod my lord, "the nexte tyme I wol fonde	"Quiet!" said my lord, "the next time I will endeavor
To bryngen oure craft al in another plite,	To bring our experiment to an entirely different state,
And but I do, sires, lat me han the wite.	And unless I do, sirs, let me have the blame.
Ther was defaute in somwhat, wel I woot."	There was something wrong, I well know."
Another seyde the fir was over-hoot --	Another said the fire was too hot --
But, be it hoot or coold, I dar seye this,	But, be it hot or cold, I dare say this,
That we concluden everemoore amys.	That we conclude always with something gone wrong.
We faille of that which that we wolden have,	We fail to get that which we want to have,
And in oure madnesse everemoore we rave.	And in our madness always we rave.
And whan we been togidres everichoon,	And when we are all together every one,
Every man semeth a Salomon.	Every man seems a Solomon.
But al thyng which that shineth as the gold	But every thing thah shines like gold
Nis nat gold, as that I have herd told;	Is not gold, as I have heard said;
Ne every appul that is fair at eye	Nor every apple that is fair to the eye
Ne is nat good, what so men clappe or crye.	Is not good, whatever men may chatter or cry.
Right so, lo, fareth it amonges us:	Right so, lo, it fares among us:
He that semeth the wiseste, by Jhesus,	He who seems the wisest, by Jesus,
Is moost fool, whan it cometh to the preef;	Is the greatest fool, when it comes to the proof;
And he that semeth trewest is a theef.	And he that seems truest is a thief.
That shul ye knowe, er that I fro yow wende,	That shall you know, before I from you wend,
By that I of my tale have maad an ende.	By the time that I have made an end of my tale.
Explicit prima pars	Ther is a chanoun of religioun
There is a canon regular	Amonges us, wolde infecte al a toun,
Amongst us, who would infect a whole town,	Thogh it as greet were as was Nynyvee,
Though it were as big as was Nineveh,	Rome, Alisaundre, Troye, and othere three.
Rome, Alexandria, Troy, and any three others.	His sleightes and his infinite falsnesse
His tricks and his infinite falseness	Ther koude no man writen, as I gesse,
No man could write, as I guess,	Though that he myghte lyve a thousand yeer.
Though he might live a thousand years.	In al this world of falshede nis his peer,
In all this world is not his equal in falsehood,	For in his termes he wol hym so wynde,
For in his technical terms he will so wrap himself,	And speke his wordes in so sly a kynde,
And speak his words in so deceitful a manner,	Whanne he commune shal with any wight,
When he shall converse with any person,	That he wol make hym doten anonright,
That he will make a fool of him right away,	But it a feend be, as hymselven is.
Unless it be a fiend, as he himself is.	Ful many a man hath he bigiled er this,
Very many a man has he beguiled before this,	And wole, if that he lyve may a while;
And will, if he may live a while longer;	And yet men ride and goon ful many a mile
And yet men ride and walk very many a mile	Hym for to seke and have his aqueyntaunce,
To seek him and have his acquaintance,	Noght knowynge of his false governaunce.
Not knowing of his false way of life.	And if yow list to yeve me audience,
And if you want to listen to me,	I wol it tellen heere in youre presence.
I will tell it here in your presence.	But worshipful chanons religious,
But worshipful religious canons,	Ne demeth nat that I sclaundre youre hous,
Do not think that I slander your house,	Although that my tale of a chanoun bee.
Although my tale be about a canon.	Of every ordre som shrewe is, pardee,
There is some scoundrel in every order, by God,	And God forbede that al a compaignye
And God forbid that a whole company	Sholde rewe o singuleer mannes folye.
Should suffer for one single man's folly.	To sclaundre yow is no thyng myn entente,
To slander you is not at all my intention,	But to correcten that is mys I mente.
But I mean to correct what is amiss.	This tale was nat oonly toold for yow,
This tale was not only told for you,	But eek for othere mo; ye woot wel how
But also for many others; you know well	That among Cristes apostelles twelve
That among Christ's twelve apostles	Ther nas no traytour but Judas hymselve.
There was no traitor but Judas himself.	Thanne why sholde al the remenant have a blame
Then why should all the remnant have the blame	That giltlees were? By yow I seye the same,
Who were guiltless? Concerning you I say the same,	Save oonly this, if ye wol herkne me:
Save only this, if you will listen to me:	If any Judas in youre covent be,
If any Judas be in your convent,	Remoeveth hym bitymes, I yow rede,
Remove him quickly, I advise you,	If shame or los may causen any drede.
If the prospect of shame or dishonor can cause any fear.	And beeth no thyng displesed, I yow preye,
And be not at all displeased, I pray you,	But in this cas herkneth what I shal seye.
But in this case listen to what I shall say.	In Londoun was a preest, an annueleer,
In London was a priest, a chantry priest,	That therinne dwelled hadde many a yeer,
Who therein had dwelled many a year,	Which was so plesaunt and so servysable
Who was so pleasant and so attentive	Unto the wyf, where as he was at table,
Unto the woman, where he took his meals,	That she wolde suffre hym no thyng for to paye
That she would not allow him to pay anything	For bord ne clothyng, wente he never so gaye,
For board nor clothing, went he never so gay,	And spendyng silver hadde he right ynow.
And he had plenty of spending money.	Therof no fors; I wol procede as now,
That does not not matter; I will now proceed,	And tell forth my tale of the canon
That broghte this preest to confusioun.	Who brought this priest to ruin.
This false chanon cam upon a day	This false canon came upon one day
Unto this preestes chambre, wher he lay,	Unto this priest's chamber, where he stayed,
Bisechynge hym to lene hym a certeyn	Beseeching him to lend him a certain amount
Of gold, and he wolde quite it hym ageyn.	Of gold, and he would pay it back to him again.
"Leene me a marc," quod he, "but dayes three,	"Loan me a mark," said he, "for only three days,
And at my day I wol it quiten thee.	And at my assigned day I will repay it to thee.
And if so be that thow me fynde fals,	And if it so be that thou find me false,
Another day do hange me by the hals!"	The next day have me hanged by the neck!"
This preest hym took a marc, and that as swithe,	This priest gave him a mark, and that very quickly,
And this chanoun hym thanked ofte sithe,	And this canon thanked him many times,
And took his leve, and wente forth his weye,	And took his leave, and went forth on his way,
And at the thridde day broghte his moneye,	And at the third day brought his money,
And to the preest he took his gold agayn,	And to the priest he gave back his gold,
Wherof this preest was wonder glad and fayn.	For which this priest was wonderfully glad and happy.
"Certes," quod he, "no thyng anoyeth me	"Certainly," said he, "in no way does it annoy me
To lene a man a noble, or two, or thre,	To lend a man a noble, or two, or three,
Or what thyng were in my possessioun,	Or whatever thing if it were in my possession,
Whan he so trewe is of condicioun	When he is so true, of such character
That in no wise he breke wole his day;	That in no way will he fail to pay on his assigned day:
To swich a man I kan never seye nay."	To such a man I can never say no."
"What!" quod this chanoun, "sholde I be untrewe?	"What!" said this canon, "should I be untrue?
Nay, that were thyng yfallen al of newe.	Nay, that would be a thing completely without precedent.
Trouthe is a thyng that I wol evere kepe	My pledged word is a thing that I will always keep
Unto that day in which that I shal crepe	Until that day in which I shall creep
Into my grave, and ellis God forbede.	Into my grave, and God forbid it be otherwise.
Bileveth this as siker as your Crede.	Believe this is as true as your Creed.
God thanke I, and in good tyme be it sayd,	I thank God, and rightly it may be said,
That ther was nevere man yet yvele apayd	That there was never man yet suffered evil
For gold ne silver that he to me lente,	For gold or silver that he lent to me,
Ne nevere falshede in myn herte I mente.	Nor did I ever intend falsehood in my heart.
And sire," quod he, "now of my pryvetee,	And sir," said he, "now some of my secrets,
Syn ye so goodlich han been unto me,	Since you have been so goodly unto me,
And kithed to me so greet gentillesse,	And shown to me such great courtesy,
Somwhat to quyte with youre kyndenesse	Something with which to repay your kindness
I wol yow shewe, and if yow list to leere,	I will show you, and if you want to learn,
I wol yow teche pleynly the manere	I will teach you fully the manner
How I kan werken in philosophie.	How I know how to to work in alchemy.
Taketh good heede; ye shul wel seen at ye	Pay cl,ose attention; you shall well see by eye
That I wol doon a maistrie er I go."	That I will do a masterful work before I go."
"Ye," quod the preest, "ye, sire, and wol ye so?	"Yes," said the priest, "yes, sir, and will you so?
Marie, therof I pray yow hertely."	By Saint Mary, for that I pray you heartily."
"At youre comandement, sire, trewely,"	"At your commandment, sir, truly,"
Quod the chanoun, "and ellis God forbeede!"	Said the canon, "and otherwise God forbid!"
Loo, how this theef koude his service beede!	Lo, how this thief could offer his service!
Ful sooth it is that swich profred servyse	Very true it is that such a favor not asked for
Stynketh, as witnessen thise olde wyse,	Stinks, as these old wise writers bear witness,
And that ful soone I wol it verifie	And very soon I will verify it
In this chanoun, roote of al trecherie,	In (the deeds of) this canon, root of all treachery,
That everemoore delit hath and gladnesse --	Who evermore has delight and gladness --
Swiche feendly thoghtes in his herte impresse --	Such fiendish thoughts in his heart are fixed --
How Cristes peple he may to meschief brynge.	How he can bring Christ's people to mischief.
God kepe us from his false dissymulynge!	God keep us from his false dissimulation!
Noght wiste this preest with whom that he delte,	This priest knew not with whom he dealt,
Ne of his harm comynge he no thyng felte.	And of his coming harm he felt nothing.
O sely preest! O sely innocent!	O hapless priest! O hapless innocent!
With coveitise anon thou shalt be blent!	Very soon thou shalt be blinded by greed!
O gracelees, ful blynd is thy conceite,	O unfortunate, completely blind is thy mind,
No thyng ne artow war of the deceite	In no way art thou aware of the deceit
Which that this fox yshapen hath to thee!	Which this fox has destined for thee!
His wily wrenches thou ne mayst nat flee.	His cunning deceptions thou canst not flee.
Wherfore, to go to the conclusion,	Therefore, to go to the conclusion,
That refereth to thy confusion,	That refers to thy ruin,
Unhappy man, anon I wol me hye	Unhappy man, right now I will hasten myself
To tellen thyn unwit and thy folye,	To tell thy lack of prudence and thy folly,
And eek the falsnesse of that oother wrecche,	And also the falseness of that other wretch,
As ferforth as that my konnyng wol strecche.	Insofar as my skill will stretch.
This chanon was my lord, ye wolden weene?	This canon was my lord, you would suppose?
Sire hoost, in feith, and by the hevenes queene,	Sir host, in faith, and by the heaven's queen,
It was another chanoun, and nat hee,	It was another canon, and not he,
That kan an hundred foold moore subtiltee.	Who knows a hundred times more trickery.
He hath bitrayed folkes many tyme;	He has betrayed folks many a time;
Of his falsnesse it dulleth me to ryme.	It distresses me to compose rimes about his falseness.
Evere whan that I speke of his falshede,	Every time I speak of his falsehood,
For shame of hym my chekes wexen rede.	For shame of him my cheeks grow red.
Algates they bigynnen for to glowe,	At least they begin to glow,
For reednesse have I noon, right wel I knowe,	For redness have I none, very well I know,
In my visage; for fumes diverse	In my visage; for various fumes
Of metals, whiche ye han herd me reherce,	Of metals, which you have heard me rehearse,
Consumed and wasted han my reednesse.	That have consumed and wasted my redness.
Now taak heede of this chanons cursednesse!	Now pay attention to this canon's cursedness!
"Sire," quod he to the preest, "lat youre man gon	"Sir," said he to the priest, "have your man go
For quyksilver, that we it hadde anon;	For quicksilver, would that we had it right now;
And lat hym bryngen ounces two or three;	And have him bring two or three ounces;
And whan he comth, as faste shal ye see	And when he comes, quickly you shall see
A wonder thyng, which ye saugh nevere er this."	A wonderful thing, which you never saw before this."
"Sire," quod the preest, "it shal be doon, ywis."	"Sir," said the priest, "it shall be done, indeed."
He bad his servant fecchen hym this thyng,	He bad his servant fetch him this thing,
And he al redy was at his biddyng,	And he was all ready at his bidding,
And wente hym forth, and cam anon agayn	And went forth, and came right back again
With this quyksilver, shortly for to sayn,	With this quicksilver, shortly to say,
And took thise ounces thre to the chanoun;	And gave these three ounces to the canon;
And he hem leyde faire and wel adoun,	And he laid them down neatly and carefully,
And bad the servant coles for to brynge,	And bad the servant to bring coals,
That he anon myghte go to his werkynge.	So that he might go to his working right away.
The coles right anon weren yfet,	The coals right away were fetched,
And this chanoun took out a crosselet	And this canon took out a crucible
Of his bosom, and shewed it to the preest.	From his bosom, and showed it to the priest.
"This instrument," quod he, "which that thou seest,	"This instrument," said he, "which thou seest,
Taak in thyn hand, and put thyself therinne	Take in thy hand, and thyself put therein
Of this quyksilver an ounce, and heer bigynne,	An ounce of this quicksilver, and here begin,
In name of Crist, to wexe a philosofre.	In the name of Christ, to become an alchemist.
Ther been ful fewe to whiche I wolde profre	There are very few to whom I would offer
To shewen hem thus muche of my science.	To show them thus so much of my science.
For ye shul seen heer, by experience,	For you shall see here, by experience,
That this quyksilver I wol mortifye	That this quicksilver I will harden
Right in youre sighte anon, withouten lye,	Right in your sight indeed, without lie,
And make it as good silver and as fyn	And make it as good silver and as fine
As ther is any in youre purs or myn,	As there is any in your purse or mine,
Or elleswhere, and make it malliable;	Or elsewhere, and make it malleable;
And elles holdeth me fals and unable	And otherwise consider me false and unable
Amonges folk for evere to appeere.	For ever to appear amongst folk.
I have a poudre heer, that coste me deere,	I have a powder here, that cost me dearly,
Shal make al good, for it is cause of al	Shall make all good, for it is cause of all
My konnyng, which that I yow shewen shal.	My cunning, which I shall show you.
Voyde youre man, and lat hym be theroute,	Send away your man, and have him be outside,
And shette the dore, whils we been aboute	And shut the door, while we are about
Oure pryvetee, that no man us espie,	Our secret business, so that no man espy us,
Whils that we werke in this philosophie."	While we work in this science."
Al as he bad fulfilled was in dede.	All was in deed fulfilled as he commanded.
This ilke servant anonright out yede,	This same servant right away went out,
And his maister shette the dore anon,	And his master shut the door quickly,
And to hire labour spedily they gon.	And to their labor speedily they go.
This preest, at this cursed chanons biddyng,	This priest, at this cursed canon's bidding,
Upon the fir anon sette this thyng,	Upon the fire at once set this thing,
And blew the fir, and bisyed hym ful faste.	And blew the fire, and busied himself very intently.
And this chanoun into the crosselet caste	And this canon into the crucible cast
A poudre, noot I wherof that it was	A powder, I do not know of what it was
Ymaad, outher of chalk, outher of glas,	Made, either of chalk, or of glass,
Or somwhat elles, was nat worth a flye,	Or something else, that was not worth a fly,
To blynde with this preest; and bad hym hye	With which to blind this priest; and bade him hasten
The coles for to couchen al above	To lay all the coals above
The crosselet. "For in tokenyng I thee love,"	The crucible. "To serve as a sign that I love thee,"
Quod this chanoun, "thyne owene handes two	Said this canon, "thine own two hands
Shul werche al thyng which that shal heer be do."	Shall do every thing that shall here be done."
"Graunt mercy," quod the preest, and was ful glad,	"Many thanks," said the priest, and was very glad,
And couched coles as the chanoun bad.	And laid the coals as the canon bad.
And while he bisy was, this feendly wrecche,	And while he was busy, this fiendish wretch,
This false chanoun -- the foule feend hym fecche! --	This false canon -- may the foul fiend fetch him! --
Out of his bosom took a bechen cole,	Out of his bosom took a beech coal,
In which ful subtilly was maad an hole,	In which very skilfully was made a hole,
And therinne put was of silver lemaille	And therein was put of silver filings
An ounce, and stopped was, withouten faille,	An ounce, and was sealed shut, without doubt,
This hole with wex, to kepe the lemaille in.	This hole with wax, to keep the filings in.
And understondeth that this false gyn	And understand that this false device
Was nat maad ther, but it was maad bifore;	Was not made there, but it was made before;
And othere thynges I shal tellen moore	And other things I shall tell more
Herafterward, whiche that he with hym broghte.	Later, which he brought with him.
Er he cam there, hym to bigile he thoghte,	Before he came there, he intended to trick him,
And so he dide, er that they wente atwynne;	And so he did, before they went apart;
Til he had terved hym, koude he nat blynne.	Until he had skinned him, he could not cease.
It dulleth me whan that I of hym speke.	It distresses me when I speak of him.
On his falshede fayn wolde I me wreke,	I would like to avenge myself for his falsehood,
If I wiste how, but he is heere and there;	If I knew how, but he is now here and now there;
He is so variaunt, he abit nowhere.	He is so changeable, he abides nowhere.
But taketh heede now, sires, for Goddes love!	But pay attention now, sirs, for God's love!
He took his cole of which I spak above,	He took his coal of which I spoke above,
And in his hand he baar it pryvely.	And in his hand he bore it secretly.
And whiles the preest couched bisily	And while the priest busily laid
The coles, as I tolde yow er this,	The coals, as I told you before this,
This chanoun seyde, "Freend, ye doon amys.	This canon said, "Friend, you do it wrong.
This is nat couched as it oghte be;	This is not arranged as it ought to be;
But soone I shal amenden it," quod he.	But soon I shall amend it," said he.
"Now lat me medle therwith but a while,	"Now let me work with it but a while,
For of yow have I pitee, by Seint Gile!	For I have pity of you, by Saint Gile!
Ye been right hoot; I se wel how ye swete.	You are very hot; I see well how you sweat.
Have heere a clooth, and wipe awey the wete."	Have here a cloth, and wipe away the wetness."
And whiles that the preest wiped his face,	And while the priest wiped his face,
This chanoun took his cole -- with sory grace! --	This canon took his coal -- may he have bad luck! --
And leyde it above upon the myddeward	And laid it above, upon the middle
Of the crosselet, and blew wel afterward	Of the crucible, and blew well afterward
Til that the coles gonne faste brenne.	Until the coals began to burn fast.
"Now yeve us drynke," quod the chanoun thenne;	"Now give us drink," said the canon then;
"As swithe al shal be wel, I undertake.	"Soon all shall be well, I guarantee.
Sitte we doun, and lat us myrie make."	Sit we down, and let us make merry."
And whan that this chanounes bechen cole	And when this canon's beech coal
Was brent, al the lemaille out of the hole	Was burned, all the filings out of the hole
Into the crosselet fil anon adoun;	Into the crucible fell right down;
And so it moste nedes, by resoun,	And so it must be necessarily, by reason,
Syn it so evene above couched was.	Since it was placed so exactly above.
But therof wiste the preest nothyng, alas!	But of this the priest knew nothing, alas!
He demed alle the coles yliche good,	He thought all the coals equally good,
For of that sleighte he nothyng understood.	For he understood nothing of that trick.
And whan this alkamystre saugh his tyme,	And when this alchemist saw his time,
"Ris up," quod he, "sire preest, and stondeth by me;	"Rise up," said he, "sir priest, and stand by me;
And for I woot wel ingot have ye noon,	And because I know well you have no ingot,
Gooth, walketh forth, and bryngeth a chalk stoon;	Go, walk forth, and bring a chalk stone;
For I wol make it of the same shap	For I will make it of the same shape
That is an ingot, if I may han hap.	As is an ingot, if I may have such luck.
And bryngeth eek with yow a bolle or a panne	And bring also with you a bowl or a pan
Ful of water, and ye shul se wel thanne	Full of water, and you shall see well then
How that oure bisynesse shal thryve and preeve.	How our business shall thrive and succeed.
And yet, for ye shul han no mysbileeve	And yet, so that you shall have no suspicion
Ne wrong conceite of me in youre absence,	Nor wrong opinion of me in your absence,
I ne wol nat been out of youre presence,	I will not be out of your presence,
But go with yow and come with yow ageyn."	But go with you and come with you again."
The chambre dore, shortly for to seyn,	The chamber door, shortly to say,
They opened and shette, and wente hir weye.	They opened and shut, and went their way.
And forth with hem they carieden the keye,	And forth with them they carried the key,
And coome agayn withouten any delay.	And came back again without any delay.
What sholde I tarien al the longe day?	Why should I tarry all the long day?
He took the chalk and shoop it in the wise	He took the chalk and shaped it in the manner
Of an ingot, as I shal yow devyse.	Of an ingot, as I shall tell you.
I seye, he took out of his owene sleeve	I say, he took out of his own sleeve
A teyne of silver -- yvele moot he cheeve! --	A small bar of silver -- may he have evil luck! --
Which that ne was nat but an ounce of weighte.	Which was not more than an ounce of weight.
And taaketh heede now of his cursed sleighte!	And pay attention now to his cursed trick!
He shoop his ingot in lengthe and in breede	He shaped his ingot in the length and in the breadth
Of this teyne, withouten any drede,	Of this small bar, without any doubt,
So slyly that the preest it nat espide,	So slyly that the priest did not see it,
And in his sleve agayn he gan it hide,	And in his sleeve again he did hide it,
And fro the fir he took up his mateere,	And from the fire he took up his material,
And in th'yngot putte it with myrie cheere,	And put it in the ingot with merry demeanor,
And in the water-vessel he it caste,	And in the pan of water he cast it,
Whan that hym luste, and bad the preest as faste,	When it pleased him, and commanded the priest quickly,
"Loke what ther is; put in thyn hand and grope.	"See what is there; put in thy hand and grope.
Thow fynde shalt ther silver, as I hope."	Thou shalt find there silver, as I believe."
What, devel of helle, sholde it elles be?	What else, devil of hell, should it be?
Shaving of silver silver is, pardee!	Shaving of silver is silver, by God!
He putte his hand in and took up a teyne	He put his hand in and took up a small bar
Of silver fyn, and glad in every veyne	Of pure silver, and glad in every vein
Was this preest, whan he saugh it was so.	Was this priest, when he saw it was so.
"Goddes blessyng, and his moodres also,	"God's blessing, and his mother's also,
And alle halwes, have ye, sire chanoun,"	And all saints, have you (in their protection), sir canon,"
Seyde the preest, "and I hir malisoun,	Said the priest, "and may I have their curse,
But, and ye vouche-sauf to techen me	But, if you condescend to teach me
This noble craft and this subtilitee,	This noble craft and this esoteric art,
I wol be youre in al that evere I may."	I will be yours in all that ever I can."
Quod the chanoun, "Yet wol I make assay	Said the canon, "Yet I will make trial
The seconde tyme, that ye may taken heede	The second time, that you may pay attention
And been expert of this, and in youre neede	And be expert concerning this, and when you are in need
Another day assaye in myn absence	Some other day in my absence to try out
This disciplyne and this crafty science.	This discipline and this ingenious science.
Lat take another ounce," quod he tho,	Let's take another ounce," said he then,
"Of quyksilver, withouten wordes mo,	"Of quicksilver, without more words,
And do therwith as ye han doon er this	And do therewith as you have done before this
With that oother, which that now silver is."	With that other, which now is silver."
This preest hym bisieth in al that he kan	This priest busies himself in all that he knows how
To doon as this chanoun, this cursed man,	To do as this canon, this cursed man,
Comanded hym, and faste blew the fir,	Commanded him, and blew hard on the fire,
For to come to th' effect of his desir.	In order to come to the realization of his desire.
And this chanon, right in the meene while,	And this canon, at exactly the same time,
Al redy was this preest eft to bigile,	Was all ready to beguile this priest again,
And for a contenaunce in his hand he bar	And for show in his hand he bore
An holwe stikke -- taak kep and be war! --	A hollow stick -- pay attention and beware! --
In the ende of which an ounce, and namoore,	In the end of which an ounce, and no more,
Of silver lemaille put was, as bifore	Of silver filings was put, as before
Was in his cole, and stopped with wex weel	Was in his coal, and well sealed shut with wax
For to kepe in his lemaille every deel.	To keep in his filings every bit.
And whil this preest was in his bisynesse,	And while this priest was busy with his work,
This chanoun with his stikke gan hym dresse	This canon with his stick began to go
To hym anon, and his poudre caste in	To him right away, and his powder cast in
As he dide er -- the devel out of his skyn	As he did before-- the devil out of his skin
Hym terve, I pray to God, for his falshede!	Flay him, I pray to God, for his falsehood!
For he was evere fals in thoght and dede --	For he was ever false in thought and deed --
And with this stikke, above the crosselet,	And with this stick, above the crucible,
That was ordeyned with that false jet,	That was prepared with that false contrivance,
He stired the coles til relente gan	He stirred the coals until it began to melt
The wex agayn the fir, as every man,	The wax next to the fire, as every man,
But it a fool be, woot wel it moot nede,	Unless he be a fool, knows well it must by necessity,
And al that in the stikke was out yede,	And all that was in the stick went out,
And in the crosselet hastily it fel.	And into the crucible it quickly fell.
Now, good sires, what wol ye bet than wel?	Now, good sirs, what more will you have?
Whan that this preest thus was bigiled ageyn,	When this priest was thus beguiled again,
Supposynge noght but treuthe, sooth to seyn,	Supposing nothing but truth, sooth to say,
He was so glad that I kan nat expresse	He was so glad that I can not express
In no manere his myrthe and his gladnesse;	In any manner his mirth and his gladness;
And to the chanoun he profred eftsoone	And to the canon he offered again
Body and good. "Ye," quod the chanoun soone,	Body and possessions. "Yes," quickly said the canon,
"Though poure I be, crafty thou shalt me fynde.	"Though I be poor, thou shalt find me skilfull.
I warne thee, yet is ther moore bihynde.	I warn thee, there is yet more to come.
Is ther any coper herinne?" seyde he.	Is there any copper here?" said he.
"Ye," quod the preest, "sire, I trowe wel ther be."	"Yes," said the priest, "sir, I believe well there is some."
"Elles go bye us som, and that as swithe;	"Otherwise go buy us some, and do that quickly;
Now, goode sire, go forth thy wey and hy the."	Now, good sir, go forth thy way and hurry thee."
He wente his wey, and with the coper cam,	He went his way, and with the copper came back,
And this chanon it in his handes nam,	And this canon took it in his hands,
And of that coper weyed out but an ounce.	And of that copper weighed out only an ounce.
Al to symple is my tonge to pronounce,	All too simple is my tongue to pronounce,
As ministre of my wit, the doublenesse	As servant of my wit, the duplicity
Of this chanoun, roote of alle cursednesse!	Of this canon, root of all cursedness!
He semed freendly to hem that knewe hym noght,	He seemed friendly to those that did not know him,
But he was feendly bothe in werk and thoght.	But he was fiendish both in deed and thought.
It weerieth me to telle of his falsnesse,	It wearies me to tell of his falseness,
And nathelees yet wol I it expresse,	And nonetheless I will yet express it,
To th'entente that men may be war therby,	With the intention that men may be warned by this,
And for noon oother cause, trewely.	And for no other cause, truly.
He putte this ounce of coper in the crosselet,	He put this ounce of copper in the crucible,
And on the fir as swithe he hath it set,	And on the fire quickly he has set it,
And caste in poudre, and made the preest to blowe,	And cast in powder, and made the priest to blow,
And in his werkyng for to stoupe lowe,	And in his working to stoop low,
As he dide er -- and al nas but a jape;	As he did before -- and all was nothing but a trick;
Right as hym liste, the preest he made his ape!	Exactly as he wished, he made the priest his ape!
And afterward in the ingot he it caste,	And afterward he cast the ingot in it,
And in the panne putte it at the laste	And put it at the last into the pan
Of water, and in he putte his owene hand,	Of water, and in he put his own hand,
And in his sleve (as ye biforen-hand	And in his sleeve (as you before-hand
Herde me telle) he hadde a silver teyne.	Heard me tell) he had a small bar of silver.
He slyly took it out, this cursed heyne,	He slyly took it out, this cursed rascal,
Unwityng this preest of his false craft,	This priest not knowing of his false craft,
And in the pannes botme he hath it laft;	And in the pan's bottom he has left it;
And in the water rombled to and fro,	And in the water groped noisily about to and fro,
And wonder pryvely took up also	And wonderfully secretly took up also
The coper teyne, noght knowynge this preest,	The copper bar, this priest not knowing,
And hidde it, and hym hente by the breest,	And hid it, and grabbed him by his coat,
And to hym spak, and thus seyde in his game:	And to him spoke, and thus said jokingly:
"Stoupeth adoun. By God, ye be to blame!	"Stoop down. By God, you are to blame!
Helpeth me now, as I dide yow whileer;	Help me now, as I did you before;
Putte in youre hand, and looketh what is theer."	Put in your hand, and see what is there."
This preest took up this silver teyne anon,	This priest quickly took up this silver bar,
And thanne seyde the chanoun, "Lat us gon	And then said the canon, "Let us go
With thise thre teynes, whiche that we han wroght,	With these three bars, which we have wrought,
To som goldsmyth and wite if they been oght,	To some goldsmith and learn if they are worth anything,
For, by my feith, I nolde, for myn hood,	For, by my faith, I would not (have them), for (the cost of) my hood,
But if that they were silver fyn and good,	Unless they be silver pure and good,
And that as swithe preeved it shal bee."	And that very quickly shall be tested."
Unto the goldsmyth with thise teynes three	Unto the goldsmith with these three bars
They wente and putte thise teynes in assay	They went and put these bars to the test
To fir and hamer; myghte no man seye nay,	Of fire and hammer; no man could say nay,
But that they weren as hem oghte be.	But that they were as they ought to be.
This sotted preest, who was gladder than he?	This deluded priest, who was gladder than he?
Was nevere brid gladder agayn the day,	Was never bird more glad at daybreak,
Ne nyghtyngale, in the sesoun of May,	Nor nightingale in the season of May,
Was nevere noon that luste bet to synge;	Was never none that was more eager to sing;
Ne lady lustier in carolynge,	Nor lady more enthusiastic in singing carols to spring,
Or for to speke of love and wommanhede,	Or to speak of love and womanhood,
Ne knyght in armes to doon an hardy dede,	Nor knight in arms to do a hardy deed,
To stonden in grace of his lady deere,	To stand in the good graces of his dear lady,
Than hadde this preest this soory craft to leere.	Than this priest had to learn this sorry craft.
And to the chanoun thus he spak and seyde:	And to the canon thus he spoke and said:
"For love of God, that for us alle deyde,	"For love of God, Who died for us all,
And as I may deserve it unto yow,	And as I may deserve (to have) it from you,
What shal this receite coste? Telleth now!"	What shall this recipe cost? Tell now!"
"By oure Lady," quod this chanon, "it is deere,	"By our Lady," said this canon, "it is expensive,
I warne yow wel; for save I and a frere,	I warn you well; for except for me and a friar,
In Engelond ther kan no man it make."	There is no man in England who can make it."
"No fors," quod he, "now, sire, for Goddes sake,	"No matter," said he, "now, sir, for God's sake,
What shal I paye? Telleth me, I preye."	What shall I pay? Tell me, I pray."
"Ywis," quod he, "it is ful deere, I seye.	"Indeed," said he, "as I say, it is very expensive.
Sire, at o word, if that thee list it have,	Sir, at one word, if thou want to have it,
Ye shul paye fourty pound, so God me save!	You must pay forty pounds, so help me God!
And nere the freendshipe that ye dide er this	And were it not for the act of friendship that before this you did
To me, ye sholde paye moore, ywis."	To me, you should pay more, indeed."
This preest the somme of fourty pound anon	This priest right away the sum of forty pounds
Of nobles fette, and took hem everichon	Of nobles fetched, and gave every one of them
To this chanoun for this ilke receite.	To this canon for this same recipe.
Al his werkyng nas but fraude and deceite.	All his working was nothing but fraud and deceit.
"Sire preest," he seyde, "I kepe han no loos	"Sir priest," he said, "I do not care to have fame
Of my craft, for I wolde it kept were cloos;	For my craft, for I would that it were kept confidential;
And, as ye love me, kepeth it secree.	And, as you love me, keep it secret.
For, and men knewen al my soutiltee,	For, if men knew of all my esoteric skill,
By God, they wolden han so greet envye	By God, they would have so great envy
To me by cause of my philosophye	Of me because of my science
I sholde be deed; ther were noon oother weye."	I should be dead; there would be no other way."
"God it forbeede," quod the preest, "what sey ye?	"God forbid it," said the priest, "what say you?
Yet hadde I levere spenden al the good	Yet would I rather spend all the wealth
Which that I have, and elles wexe I wood,	That I have, and otherwise I would rather go mad,
Than that ye sholden falle in swich mescheef."	Than that you should fall in such distress."
"For youre good wyl, sire, have ye right good preef,"	"For your good will, sir, you have givem right good proof,"
Quod the chanoun, "and farwel, grant mercy!"	Said the canon, "and farewell, many thanks!"
He wente his wey, and never the preest hym sy	He went his way, and never the priest him saw
After that day; and whan that this preest shoolde	After that day; and when this priest should
Maken assay, at swich tyme as he wolde,	At such time as he wanted, make a trial
Of this receit, farwel! It wolde nat be.	Of this recipe, farewell! It would not work.

And in hir termes sette hir lust and peyne,	And in their technical terms set their desire and pain,
But to hir purpos shul they nevere atteyne.	But to their purpose shall they never attain.
A man may lightly lerne, if he have aught,	A man can easily learn, if he have anything,
To multiplie, and brynge his good to naught!	To transmute metals, and bring his wealth to nothing!
Lo! swich a lucre is in this lusty game,	Lo! such a profit is in this pleasing game,
A mannes myrthe it wol turne unto grame,	It will turn a man's mirth into sorrow,

If that youre eyen kan nat seen aright,	If your eyes can not see clearly,
Looke that youre mynde lakke noght his sight.	See that your mind lacks nothing of its sight.

Ye shul nothyng wynne on that chaffare,	You shall gain nothing on that transaction,
But wasten al that ye may rape and renne.	But waste all that you can steal and carry away.

Noght fer fro thilke paleys honurable,	Not far from that same noble palace,
Wher as this markys shoop his mariage,	Where this marquis planned his marriage,
There stood a throop, of site delitable,	There stood a small village, in a delightful location,

For povreliche yfostred up was she,	Because she was raised in poverty,
No likerous lust was thurgh hire herte yronne.	No sensual desire had run through her heart.

Ful ofte sithe this markys sette his ye	Very many times this marquis set his eye
As he on huntyng rood paraventure;	By chance, as he on hunting rode;

Upon hir chiere he wolde hym ofte avyse,	Upon her demeanor he would often think,
Commendynge in his herte hir wommanhede,	Commending in his heart her womanly qualities,
And eek hir vertu, passynge any wight	And also her virtue, passing any person
Of so yong age, as wel in chiere as dede.	Of so young age, as well in manner as deed.
For thogh the peple have no greet insight	For though the people have no great insight
In vertu, he considered ful right	In virtue, he considered very carefully
Hir bountee, and disposed that he wolde	Her goodness, and decided that he would
Wedde hire oonly, if evere he wedde sholde.	Wed her only, if ever he should wed.
The day of weddyng cam, but no wight kan	The day of wedding came, but no person can
Telle what womman that it sholde be;	Tell what woman it should be;
For which merveille wondred many a man,	For which marvel wondered many a man,
And seyden, whan they were in privetee,	And said, when they were in private,
"Wol nat oure lord yet leve his vanytee?	"Will not our lord yet leave his vanity?
Wol he nat wedde? Allas! Allas, the while!	Will he not wed? Alas! Alas, the times!
Why wole he thus hymself and us bigile?"	Why will he thus himself and us deceive?"
But nathelees this markys hath doon make	But nevertheless this marquis has made
Of gemmes, set in gold and in asure,	Of gems, set in gold and in azure,
Brooches and rynges, for Grisildis sake;	Brooches and rings, for Griselda's sake;

And of his retenue the bachelrye,	And of his retinue the knights,
With many a soun of sondry melodye,	With many a sound of varied melody,
Unto the village of the which I tolde	Unto the village of which I told
In this array the righte wey han holde.	In this splendid array the direct route have held.

To fecchen water at a welle is went,	Has gone to fetch water at a well,
And cometh hoom as soone as ever she may;	And comes home as soon as ever she can;
For wel she hadde herd seyd that thilke day	For well she had heard said that same day

That been my felawes, in oure dore and se	Who are my fellows, in our door and see
The markysesse, and therfore wol I fonde	The marchioness, and therefore will I try
To doon at hoom, as soone as it may be,	To do at home, as soon as it can be,
The labour which that longeth unto me,	The chores that I must do,
And thanne I may at leyser hire biholde,	And then I may at leisure her behold,
If she this wey unto the castel holde."	If she takes this way to the castle."
And as she wolde over hir threshold gon,	And as she would over her threshold go,
The markys cam and gan hire for to calle;	The marquis came and called her;
And she set doun hir water pot anon,	And she set down her water pot quickly,
Biside the thresshfold, in an oxes stalle,	Beside the threshold, in an ox's stall,
And doun upon hir knes she gan to falle,	And down upon her knees she fell,
And with sad contenance kneleth stille,	And with sober countenance kneels without speaking,
Til she had herd what was the lordes wille.	Until she had heard what was the lord's will.

Ful sobrely, and seyde in this manere:	Full soberly, and said in this manner:
"Where is youre fader, O Grisildis?" he sayde.	"Where is your father, O Griselda?" he said.
And she with reverence, in humble cheere,	And she with reverence, in humble manner,
Answerde, "Lord, he is al redy heere."	Answered, "Lord, he is right here."
And in she gooth withouten lenger lette,	And in she goes without longer delay,
And to the markys she hir fader fette.	And to the marquis she fetched her father.
He by the hand thanne took this olde man,	He by the hand then took this old man,
And seyde thus, whan he hym hadde asyde:	And said thus, when he had him aside:
"Janicula, I neither may ne kan	"Janicula, I neither may nor can

That reed he wax; abayst and al quakynge	That he grew red; abashed and all trembling
He stood; unnethes seyde he wordes mo,	He stood; hardly said he any more words,
But oonly thus: "Lord," quod he, "my willynge	But only thus: "Lord," said he, "my desire
Is as ye wole, ne ayeynes youre likynge	Is as you wish, and against your pleasure
I wol no thyng, ye be my lord so deere;	I will do nothing, you are my lord so dear;
Right as yow lust, governeth this mateere."	Right as you please, govern this matter."
"Yet wol I," quod this markys softely,	"Yet I want," said this marquis softly,
"That in thy chambre I and thou and she	"That in thy chamber I and thou and she
Have a collacioun, and wostow why?	Have a discussion, and knowest thou why?
For I wol axe if it hire wille be	For I will ask if it be her will

And al this shal be doon in thy presence;	And all this shall be done in thy presence;
I wol noght speke out of thyn audience."	I will say nothing out of thy hearing."
And in the chambre, whil they were aboute	And in the chamber, while they were engaged in
Hir tretys, which as ye shal after heere,	Their negotiation, which you shall after hear,
The peple cam unto the hous withoute,	The people came unto outside the house,
And wondred hem in how honest manere	And wondered in what a virtuous manner

But outrely Grisildis wondre myghte,	But certainly Griselda might wonder,
For nevere erst ne saugh she swich a sighte.	For never before saw she such a sight.
No wonder is thogh that she were astoned	Though it is no wonder that she was astonished
To seen so greet a gest come in that place;	To see so great a guest come in that place;
She nevere was to swiche gestes woned,	She never was accustomed to such guests,
For which she looked with ful pale face.	For which she looked full pale in her face.
But shortly forth this matere for to chace,	But shortly forth this matter to pursue,
Thise arn the wordes that the markys sayde	These are the words that the marquis said
To this benigne, verray, feithful mayde:	To this benign, true, faithful maid:
"Grisilde," he seyde, "ye shal wel understonde	"Griselda," he said, "you shall well understand

As I suppose, ye wol that it so be.	As I suppose, that you desire that it so be.
But thise demandes axe I first," quod he,	But these questions ask I first," said he,
"That, sith it shal be doon in hastif wyse,	"That, since it shall be done in a hasty manner,
Wol ye assente, or elles yow avyse?	Will you assent, or else think it over?
"I seye this: be ye redy with good herte	"I say this: are you ready (to submit) with good heart
To al my lust, and that I frely may,	To all my desires, and that I freely may,
As me best thynketh, do yow laughe or smerte,	As seems best to me, make you laugh or feel pain,
And nevere ye to grucche it, nyght ne day?	And you never to grouch about it, at any time?
And eek whan I sey `ye,' ne sey nat `nay,'	And also when I say `yes,' say not `nay,'
Neither by word ne frownyng contenance?	Neither by word nor frowning countenance?
Swere this, and heere I swere oure alliance."	Swear this, and here I swear our alliance."
Wondrynge upon this word, quakynge for drede,	Wondering upon these words, trembling for fear,
She seyde, "Lord, undigne and unworthy	She said, "Lord, unsuitable and unworthy
Am I to thilke honour that ye me beede,	Am I of that same honor that you offer me,
But as ye wole youreself, right so wol I.	But as you desire yourself, right so desire I.
And heere I swere that nevere willyngly,	And here I swear that never willingly,
In werk ne thoght, I nyl yow disobeye,	In deed nor thought, will I disobey you,
For to be deed, though me were looth to deye."	Even to be dead, though I would hate to die."
"This is ynogh, Grisilde myn," quod he.	"This is enough, Griselda mine," said he.
And forth he gooth with a ful sobre cheere	And forth he goes with a full sober manner
Out at the dore, and after that cam she,	Out of the door, and after that came she,
And to the peple he seyde in this manere:	And to the people he said in this manner:
"This is my wyf," quod he, "that standeth heere.	"This is my wife," said he, "that stands here.
Honoureth hire and loveth hire, I preye,	Honor her and love her, I pray,
Whoso me loveth; ther is namoore to seye."	Whoever loves me; there is no more to say."
And for that no thyng of hir olde geere	And so that nothing of her old belongings
She sholde brynge into his hous, he bad	She should bring into his house, he ordered
That wommen sholde dispoillen hire right theere;	That women should undress her right there;

Wedded with fortunat honestetee,	Wedded with beneficial virtue,
In Goddes pees lyveth ful esily	In God's peace lives full easily
At hoom, and outward grace ynogh had he;	At home, and to all appearances he had sufficient happiness;
And for he saugh that under low degree	And because he saw that under low social rank
Was ofte vertu hid, the peple hym heelde	Was often virtue hid, the people considered him
A prudent man, and that is seyn ful seelde.	A prudent man, and that is seen full seldom.
Nat oonly this Grisildis thurgh hir wit	Not only this Griselda through her wit
Koude al the feet of wyfly hoomlinesse,	Knew all the skills of a housewife's duties,
But eek, whan that the cas required it,	But also, when the situation required it,
The commune profit koude she redresse.	The public good could she promote.
Ther nas discord, rancour, ne hevynesse	There was no discord, rancor, nor sadness
In al that land that she ne koude apese,	In all that land that she could not alleviate,
And wisely brynge hem alle in reste and ese.	And wisely bring them all in rest and ease.
Though that hire housbonde absent were anon,	Though her husband was absent at the time,
If gentil men or othere of hire contree	If noble men or others of her country
Were wrothe, she wolde bryngen hem aton;	Were wroth, she would bring them to agreement;
So wise and rype wordes hadde she,	Such wise and well considered words had she,
And juggementz of so greet equitee,	And judgments of such great justice,
That she from hevene sent was, as men wende,	That she was sent from heaven, as men supposed,
Peple to save and every wrong t'amende.	People to save and every wrong to amend.
Nat longe tyme after that this Grisild	Not long time after this Griselda
Was wedded, she a doghter hath ybore,	Was married, she has borne a daughter,
Al had hire levere have born a knave child;	Although she would rather have given birth to a male child;
Glad was this markys and the folk therfore,	Glad was this marquis and the folk for this,
For though a mayde child coome al bifore,	For though a maid child came all before,
She may unto a knave child atteyne	She may unto a male child attain
By liklihede, syn she nys nat bareyne.	By likelihood, since she is not barren.
Ther fil, as it bifalleth tymes mo,	There happened, as it befalls many times,
Whan that this child had souked but a throwe,	When this child had suckled but a short time,
This markys in his herte longeth so	This marquis in his heart longs so
To tempte his wyf, hir sadnesse for to knowe,	To test his wife, her constancy to know,
That he ne myghte out of his herte throwe	That he could not out of his heart throw
This merveillous desir his wyf t'assaye;	This strange desire to test his wife;
Nedelees, God woot, he thoghte hire for t'affraye.	Needless, God knows, he intended to frighten her.
He hadde assayed hire ynogh bifore,	He had tested her enough before,
And foond hire evere good; what neded it	And found her always good; why was it needed
Hire for to tempte, and alwey moore and moore,	To test her, and always more and more,
Though som men preise it for a subtil wit?	Though some men praise its ingenuity?
But as for me, I seye that yvele it sit	But as for me, I say that it ill befits one
To assaye a wyf whan that it is no nede,	To test a wife when there is no need,
And putten hire in angwyssh and in drede.	And put her in anguish and in dread.
For which this markys wroghte in this manere:	For which this marquis worked in this manner:
He cam allone a-nyght, ther as she lay,	He came alone at night, where she lay,
With stierne face and with ful trouble cheere,	With stern face and with a very troubled manner,
And seyde thus: "Grisilde," quod he, "that day	And said thus: "Griselda," said he, "that day
That I yow took out of youre povere array,	That I took you out of your impoverished situation,
And putte yow in estaat of heigh noblesse --	And put you in the condition of high nobility --
Ye have nat that forgeten, as I gesse?	You have not forgotten that, as I suppose?
"I seye, Grisilde, this present dignitee,	"I say, Griselda, this present high social position,
In which that I have put yow, as I trowe,	In which I have put you, as I believe,
Maketh yow nat foryetful for to be	Requires that you be not forgetful
That I yow took in povre estaat ful lowe,	That I took you in a poor, very humble condition,
For any wele ye moot youreselven knowe.	Despite any present prosperity you must know it yourself.
Taak heede of every word that y yow seye;	Take heed of every word that I say to you;
Ther is no wight that hereth it but we tweye.	There is no person that hears it but we two.
"Ye woot youreself wel how that ye cam heere	"You know well yourself how you came here
Into this hous, it is nat longe ago;	Into this house, it is not long ago;
And though to me that ye be lief and deere,	And though to me you are beloved and dear,
Unto my gentils ye be no thyng so.	Unto my nobles you are not at all so.
They seyn, to hem it is greet shame and wo	They say, to them it is great shame and woe
For to be subgetz and been in servage	To be subjects and be in servitude
To thee, that born art of a smal village.	To thee, that art born in a humble village.
"And namely sith thy doghter was ybore	"And especially since thy daughter was born
Thise wordes han they spoken, doutelees.	These words have they spoken, doubtless.
But I desire, as I have doon bifore,	But I desire, as I have done before,
To lyve my lyf with hem in reste and pees.	To live my life with them in rest and peace.
I may nat in this caas be recchelees;	I can not be imprudent in this case;
I moot doon with thy doghter for the beste,	I must do with thy daughter for the best,
Nat as I wolde, but as my peple leste.	Not as I would want, but as my people desire.
"And yet, God woot, this is ful looth to me;	"And yet, God knows, this is full hateful to me;
But nathelees withoute youre wityng	But nevertheless without your knowledge
I wol nat doon; but this wol I," quod he,	I will not do anything; but this I desire," said he,
"That ye to me assente as in this thyng.	"That you assent to me in this matter.
Shewe now youre pacience in youre werkyng,	Show now in your actions your patience,
That ye me highte and swore in youre village	That you promised me and swore in your village
That day that maked was oure mariage."	That day that our marriage was made."
Whan she had herd al this, she noght ameved	When she had heard all this, she changed not
Neither in word, or chiere, or contenaunce,	Neither in word, nor manner, nor countenance,
For, as it semed, she was nat agreved.	For, as it seemed, she was not aggrieved.
She seyde, "Lord, al lyth in youre plesaunce.	She said, "Lord, all is subject to your pleasure.
My child and I, with hertely obeisaunce,	My child and I, with heart-felt obedience,
Been youres al, and ye mowe save or spille	Are entirely yours, and you may save or kill
Youre owene thyng; werketh after youre wille.	Your own thing; do as you will.
"Ther may no thyng, God so my soule save,	"There can nothing, as God my soul may save,
Liken to yow that may displese me;	Please you that may displease me;
Ne I desire no thyng for to have,	Nor do I desire to have anything,
Ne drede for to leese, save oonly yee.	Nor dread to lose, save only you.
This wyl is in myn herte, and ay shal be;	This will is in my heart, and ever shall be;
No lengthe of tyme or deeth may this deface,	No length of time or death can obliterate this,
Ne chaunge my corage to another place."	Nor change my heart to another place."
Glad was this markys of hire answeryng,	Glad was this marquis of her answer,
But yet he feyned as he were nat so;	But yet he feigned as if he were not so;
Al drery was his cheere and his lookyng,	All sorrowful was his manner and his look,
Whan that he sholde out of the chambre go.	When he had to go out of the chamber.
Soone after this, a furlong wey or two,	Soon after this, in a few minutes,
He prively hath toold al his entente	He privately has told all his plan
Unto a man, and to his wyf hym sente.	Unto a man, and sent him to his wife.
A maner sergeant was this privee man,	A sort of sergeant (policeman) was this confidential servant,
The which that feithful ofte he founden hadde	Whom he had often found faithful
In thynges grete, and eek swich folk wel kan	In important matters, and also such folk well can
Doon execucioun in thynges badde.	Carry out their orders in evil matters.
The lord knew wel that he hym loved and dradde;	The lord knew well that he loved and dreaded him;
And whan this sergeant wiste his lordes wille,	And when this sergeant knew his lord's will,
Into the chambre he stalked hym ful stille.	Into the chamber he stalked very quietly.
"Madame," he seyde, "ye moote foryeve it me,	"Madame," he said, "you must forgive it me,
Though I do thyng to which I am constreyned.	Though I do a thing to which I am constrained.
Ye been so wys that ful wel knowe ye	You are so wise that full well you know
That lordes heestes mowe nat been yfeyned;	That lords' commands may not be evaded (by feigning);
They mowe wel been biwailled or compleyned,	They may well be bewailed or complained of,
But men moote nede unto hire lust obeye,	But men must by necessity unto their desires obey,
And so wol I; ther is namoore to seye.	And so will I; there is no more to say.
"This child I am comanded for to take" --	"This child I am commanded to take" --
And spak namoore, but out the child he hente	And spoke no more, but out the child he seized
Despitously, and gan a cheere make	Mercilessly, and made a face
As though he wolde han slayn it er he wente.	As if he would have slain it before he went.
Grisildis moot al suffre and al consente,	Griselda must suffer all and consent to all,
And as a lamb she sitteth meke and stille,	And as a lamb she sits meek and still,
And leet this crueel sergeant doon his wille.	And let this cruel sergeant do his will.
Suspecious was the diffame of this man,	Suspicious was the bad reputation of this man,
Suspect his face, suspect his word also;	Suspect his face, suspect his word also;
Suspect the tyme in which he this bigan.	Suspect the time in which he this began.
Allas! Hir doghter that she loved so,	Alas! Her daughter that she loved so,
She wende he wolde han slawen it right tho.	She thought he would have slain it right then.
But nathelees she neither weep ne syked,	But nevertheless she neither wept nor sighed,
Conformynge hire to that the markys lyked.	Conforming herself to what the marquis pleased.
But atte laste to speken she bigan,	But at the last she began to speak,
And mekely she to the sergeant preyde,	And meekly she to the sergeant prayed,
So as he was a worthy gentil man,	As he was a worthy gentle man,
That she moste kisse hire child er that it deyde.	That she might kiss her child before it died.
And in hir barm this litel child she leyde	And in her lap this little child she laid
With ful sad face, and gan the child to blisse,	With full sad face, and blessed the child,
And lulled it, and after gan it kisse.	And lulled it, and afterward kissed it.
And thus she seyde in hire benigne voys,	And thus she said in her benign voice,
"Fareweel my child! I shal thee nevere see.	"Farewell my child! I shall thee never see.
But sith I thee have marked with the croys	But since I have marked thee with the cross
Of thilke Fader -- blessed moote he be! --	Of that same Father -- blessed may he be! --
That for us deyde upon a croys of tree,	That for us died upon a cross of wood,
Thy soule, litel child, I hym bitake,	Thy soul, little child, I entrust to him,
For this nyght shaltow dyen for my sake."	For this night shalt thou die for my sake."
I trowe that to a norice in this cas	I believe that to a nurse in this case
It had been hard this reuthe for to se;	It would have been hard this pitiful situation to see;
Wel myghte a mooder thanne han cryd "allas!"	Well might a mother then have cried "alas!"
But nathelees so sad stidefast was she	But nevertheless so firmly steadfast was she
That she endured al adversitee,	That she endured all adversity,
And to the sergeant mekely she sayde,	And to the sergeant meekly she said,
"Have heer agayn youre litel yonge mayde.	"Have here again your little young maid.
"Gooth now," quod she, "and dooth my lordes heeste;	"Go now," said she, "and do my lord's command;
But o thyng wol I prey yow of youre grace,	But one thing will I pray you of your grace,
That, but my lord forbad yow, atte leeste	That, unless my lord forbad you, at the least
Burieth this litel body in som place	Bury this little body in some place
That beestes ne no briddes it torace."	That no beasts nor birds tear it to pieces."
But he no word wol to that purpos seye,	But he no word will say to that proposal,
But took the child and wente upon his weye.	But took the child and went upon his way.
This sergeant cam unto his lord ageyn,	This sergeant came unto his lord again,
And of Grisildis wordes and hire cheere	And of Griselda's words and her manner
He tolde hym point for point, in short and pleyn,	He told him in detail, in short and plain (words),
And hym presenteth with his doghter deere.	And presents him with his daughter dear.
Somwhat this lord hadde routhe in his manere,	Somewhat this lord had pity in his manner,
But nathelees his purpos heeld he stille,	But nevertheless his purpose held he still,
As lordes doon, whan they wol han hir wille;	As lords do, when they will have their will;
And bad this sergeant that he pryvely	And commanded this sergeant that he secretly
Sholde this child softe wynde and wrappe,	Should this child softly wind and wrap (in a blanket),
With alle circumstances tendrely,	With every care tenderly,
And carie it in a cofre or in a lappe;	And carry it in a box or in a folded cloth;
But, upon peyne his heed of for to swappe,	But, upon pain of having his head cut off,
That no man sholde knowe of his entente,	No man should know of his intention,
Ne whenne he cam, ne whider that he wente;	Nor whence he came, nor whither he went;
But at Boloigne to his suster deere,	But at Bologna to his sister dear,
That thilke tyme of Panik was countesse,	Who at that very time was countess of Panik,
He sholde it take and shewe hire this mateere,	He should take it and explain to her this matter,
Bisekynge hire to doon hire bisynesse	Beseeching her to do her best
This child to fostre in alle gentillesse;	This child to nurture in all noble manners;
And whos child that it was he bad hire hyde	And whose child that it was he commanded her to hide
From every wight, for oght that may bityde.	From every person, for anything that may happen.
The sergeant gooth, and hath fulfild this thyng;	The sergeant goes, and has fulfilled this order;
But to this markys now retourne we.	But to this marquis we now return.
For now gooth he ful faste ymaginyng	For now he goes very intently considering
If by his wyves cheere he myghte se,	If by his wife's appearance he might see,
Or by hire word aperceyve, that she	Or by her word perceive, if she
Were chaunged; but he nevere hire koude fynde	Were changed; but he never could find her
But evere in oon ylike sad and kynde.	Anything but always the same, alike steadfast and kind.
As glad, as humble, as bisy in servyse,	As glad, as humble, as diligent in service,
And eek in love, as she was wont to be,	And also in love, as she was accustomed to be,
Was she to hym in every maner wyse;	Was she to him in every sort of way;
Ne of hir doghter noght a word spak she.	Nor of her daughter not a word spoke she.
Noon accident, for noon adversitee,	No external sign, for any adversity,
Was seyn in hire, ne nevere hir doghter name	Was seen in her, and never her daughter's name
Ne nempned she, in ernest nor in game.	Mentioned she, in earnest nor in jest (in any way).
In this estaat ther passed been foure yeer	In this condition there are passed four years
Er she with childe was, but, as God wolde,	Before she was with child, but, as God would,
A knave child she bar by this Walter,	A male child she bore by this Walter,
Ful gracious and fair for to biholde.	Very gracious and beautiful in appearance.
And whan that folk it to his fader tolde,	And when folk told it to his father,
Nat oonly he but al his contree merye	Not only he but all his country merry
Was for this child, and God they thanke and herye.	Was for this child, and God they thank and praise.
Whan it was two yeer old, and fro the brest	When it was two years old, and from the breast
Departed of his norice, on a day	Of his nurse weaned, on one day
This markys caughte yet another lest	This marquis caught yet another desire
To tempte his wyf yet ofter, if he may.	To test his wife yet again, if he can.
O nedelees was she tempted in assay!	O needless was she put to the test!
But wedded men ne knowe no mesure,	But wedded men know no moderation,
Whan that they fynde a pacient creature.	When they find a patient creature.
"Wyf," quod this markys, "ye han herd er this	"Wife," said this marquis, "you have heard before this
My peple sikly berth oure mariage;	My people are unhappy with our marriage;
And namely sith my sone yboren is,	And especially since my son is born,
Now is it worse than evere in al oure age.	Now is it worse than ever in all our lives.
The murmur sleeth myn herte and my corage,	The grumbling slays my heart and my feelings,
For to myne eres comth the voys so smerte	For to my ears comes the voice so sharply
That it wel ny destroyed hath myn herte.	That it well nigh has destroyed my heart.
"Now sey they thus: `Whan Walter is agon,	"Now say they thus: `When Walter is gone,
Thanne shal the blood of Janicle succede	Then shall the blood of Janicle succeed
And been oure lord, for oother have we noon.'	And be our lord, for we have no other.'
Swiche wordes seith my peple, out of drede.	Such words say my people, no doubt.
Wel oughte I of swich murmur taken heede,	Well ought I of such grumbling take heed,
For certeinly I drede swich sentence,	For certainly I dread such opinion,
Though they nat pleyn speke in myn audience.	Though they speak not plainly in my hearing.
"I wolde lyve in pees, if that I myghte;	"I would live in peace, if I could;
Wherfore I am disposed outrely,	Therefore I am firmly resolved,
As I his suster servede by nyghte,	As I dealt with his sister by night,
Right so thenke I to serve hym pryvely.	Right so I intend to deal with him secretly.
This warne I yow, that ye nat sodeynly	This I warn you, so that you not suddenly
Out of youreself for no wo sholde outreye;	For any woe should break out in a passion;
Beth pacient, and therof I yow preye."	Be patient, and for that I pray you."
"I have," quod she, "seyd thus, and evere shal:	"I have," said she, "said thus, and ever shall:
I wol no thyng, ne nyl no thyng, certayn,	I want nothing, nor will not want any thing, certainly,
But as yow list. Naught greveth me at al,	But as you desire. It does not grieve me at all,
Though that my doughter and my sone be slayn --	Though my daughter and my son be slain --
At youre comandement, this is to sayn.	At your commandment, this is to say.
I have noght had no part of children tweyne	I have not had any part of children two
But first siknesse, and after, wo and peyne.	But first sickness, and after, woe and pain.
"Ye been oure lord; dooth with youre owene thyng	"You are our lord; do with your own thing
Right as yow list; axeth no reed at me.	Right as you desire; ask no advice from me.
For as I lefte at hoom al my clothyng,	For as I left at home all my clothing,
Whan I first cam to yow, right so," quod she,	When I first came to you, right so," said she,
"Lefte I my wyl and al my libertee,	"Left I my will and all my liberty,
And took youre clothyng; wherfore I yow preye,	And took your clothing; wherefore I you pray,
Dooth youre plesaunce; I wol youre lust obeye.	Do your pleasure; I will obey your desire.
"And certes, if I hadde prescience	"And certainly, if I had foreknowledge
Youre wyl to knowe, er ye youre lust me tolde,	To know your will, before you told me your desire,
I wolde it doon withouten necligence;	I would do it without negligence;
But now I woot youre lust, and what ye wolde,	But now I know your desire, and what you want,
Al youre plesance ferme and stable I holde;	All your pleasure (whatever you wish) firm and stable I hold;
For wiste I that my deeth wolde do yow ese,	For if I knew that my death would do you ease,
Right gladly wolde I dyen, yow to plese.	Right gladly would I die, to please you.
"Deth may noght make no comparisoun	"Death can not make any comparison (is nothing compared)
Unto youre love." And whan this markys say	Unto your love." And when this marquis saw
The constance of his wyf, he caste adoun	The constancy of his wife, he cast down
His eyen two, and wondreth that she may	His eyes two, and wonders that she can
In pacience suffre al this array;	In patience suffer all this treatment;
And forth he goth with drery contenance,	And forth he goes with sorrowful countenance,
But to his herte it was ful greet plesance.	But to his heart it was full great pleasure.
This ugly sergeant, in the same wyse	This ugly sergeant, in the same manner
That he hire doghter caughte, right so he --	That he her daughter seized, right so he --
Or worse, if men worse kan devyse --	Or worse, if one can worse imagine --
Hath hent hire sone, that ful was of beautee.	Has seized her son, that was full of beauty.
And evere in oon so pacient was she	And continually so patient was she
That she no chiere maade of hevynesse,	That she made no appearance of sadness,
But kiste hir sone, and after gan it blesse;	But kissed her son, and afterwards it blessed;
Save this, she preyede hym that, if he myghte,	Save this, she prayed him that, if he could,
Hir litel sone he wolde in erthe grave	Her little son he would bury in earth
His tendre lymes, delicaat to sighte,	His tender limbs, pleasing in appearance,
Fro foweles and fro beestes for to save.	From birds and from beasts to save.
But she noon answere of hym myghte have.	But she no answer of him might have.
He wente his wey, as hym no thyng ne roghte,	He went his way, as if he cared nothing about it,
But to Boloigne he tendrely it broghte.	But to Bologna he tenderly brought it.
This markys wondred, evere lenger the moore,	This marquis wondered, more and more,
Upon hir pacience, and if that he	Upon her patience, and if he
Ne hadde soothly knowen therbifoore	Had not truly known before this
That parfitly hir children loved she,	That she perfectly loved her children,
He wolde have wend that of som subtiltee,	He would have supposed that by some trickery,
And of malice, or for crueel corage,	And out of malice, or for hard heart,
That she hadde suffred this with sad visage.	That she had suffered this with calm manner.
But wel he knew that next hymself, certayn,	But well he knew that next to himself, certainly,
She loved hir children best in every wyse.	She loved her children best in every way.
But now of wommen wolde I axen fayn	But now I would like to ask of women
If thise assayes myghte nat suffise?	If these tests might not suffice?
What koude a sturdy housbonde moore devyse	What could a cruel husband more devise
To preeve hir wyfhod and hir stedefastnesse,	To test her wifehood and her steadfastness,
And he continuynge evere in sturdinesse?	And he continuing ever in cruelty?
But ther been folk of swich condicion	But there are folk of such disposition
That whan they have a certein purpos take,	That when they have a certain purpose taken,
They kan nat stynte of hire entencion,	They can not refrain from their intention,
But, right as they were bounden to that stake,	But, right as if they were bound to that stake,
They wol nat of that firste purpos slake.	They will not from that original plan desist.
Right so this markys fulliche hath purposed	Right so this marquis has firmly decided
To tempte his wyf as he was first disposed.	To test his wife as he was first disposed.
He waiteth if by word or contenance	He watches to see if by word or countenance
That she to hym was changed of corage,	That she to him was changed in heart,
But nevere koude he fynde variance.	But never could he find variation.
She was ay oon in herte and in visage,	She was always the same in heart and in visage,
And ay the forther that she was in age,	And ever the further that she was in age,
The moore trewe, if that it were possible,	The more true, if it were possible,
She was to hym in love, and moore penyble.	She was to him in love, and more attentive.
For which it semed thus: that of hem two	For which it seemed thus: that of them two
Ther nas but o wyl, for as Walter leste,	There was but one will, for as Walter desired,
The same lust was hire plesance also.	The same desire was her pleasure also.
And, God be thanked, al fil for the beste.	And, God be thanked, all fell for the best.
She shewed wel, for no worldly unreste	She proved good; for no worldly discomfort
A wyf, as of hirself, nothing ne sholde	A wife, concerning herself, nothing should
Wille in effect, but as hir housbonde wolde.	Desire in fact, except what her husband would want.
The sclaundre of Walter ofte and wyde spradde,	The ill fame of Walter spread often and wide,
That of a crueel herte he wikkedly,	That of a cruel heart he wickedly,
For he a povre womman wedded hadde,	Because he had wedded a poor woman,
Hath mordred bothe his children prively.	Has murdered both his children secretly.
Swich murmur was among hem comunly.	Such grumbling was among them unanimously.
No wonder is, for to the peples ere	No wonder is, for to the people's ear
Ther cam no word but that they mordred were.	There came no word but that they were murdered.
For which, where as his peple therbifore	For which, whereas his people before this
Hadde loved hym wel, the sclaundre of his diffame	Had loved him well, the disgrace of his bad reputation
Made hem that they hym hatede therfore.	Made them so that they hated him for this.
To been a mordrere is an hateful name;	To be a murderer is (to have) a hateful reputation;
But nathelees, for ernest ne for game,	But nevertheless, not for any reason,
He of his crueel purpos nolde stente;	Would he of his cruel purpose desist;
To tempte his wyf was set al his entente.	To test his wife was set all his intention.
Whan that his doghter twelve yeer was of age,	When his daughter was twelve years of age,
He to the court of Rome, in subtil wyse	He to the court of Rome, (which was) in a cunning manner
Enformed of his wyl, sente his message,	Informed of his real purpose, sent his messenger,
Comaundynge hem swiche bulles to devyse	Commanding them such papal bulls to devise
As to his crueel purpos may suffyse --	As to his cruel purpose may suffice --
How that the pope, as for his peples reste,	How the pope, to restore tranquility for his people,
Bad hym to wedde another, if hym leste.	Commanded him to wed another, if he pleased.
I seye, he bad they sholde countrefete	I say, he commanded they should counterfeit
The popes bulles, makynge mencion	The pope's bulls, making mention
That he hath leve his firste wyf to lete,	That he has permission to leave his first wife,
As by the popes dispensacion,	As by the pope's dispensation,
To stynte rancour and dissencion	To stint rancor and dissension
Bitwixe his peple and hym; thus seyde the bulle,	Between his people and him; thus said the bull,
The which they han publiced atte fulle.	Which they have published widely.
The rude peple, as it no wonder is,	The ignorant people, as it no wonder is,
Wenden ful wel that it hadde be right so;	Supposed full well that it had been right so;
But whan thise tidynges came to Grisildis,	But when these tidings came to Griselda,
I deeme that hire herte was ful wo.	I believe that her heart was very woeful.
But she, ylike sad for everemo,	But she, continuously steadfast for evermore,
Disposed was, this humble creature,	Disposed was, this humble creature,
The adversitee of Fortune al t'endure,	To endure all the adversity of Fortune,
Abidynge evere his lust and his plesance,	Enduring ever his desire and his pleasure,
To whom that she was yeven herte and al,	To whom she was given, heart and all,
As to hire verray worldly suffisance.	As her true worldly source of satisfaction.
But shortly if this storie I tellen shal,	But shortly if this story I tell shall,
This markys writen hath in special	This marquis written has in detail
A lettre, in which he sheweth his entente,	A letter, in which he reveals his intention,
And secreely he to Boloigne it sente.	And secretly he sent it to Bologna.
To the Erl of Panyk, which that hadde tho	To the Earl of Panyk, who had then
Wedded his suster, preyde he specially	Wedded his sister, prayed he specifically
To bryngen hoom agayn his children two	To bring home again his two children
In honurable estaat al openly.	In a noble public display.
But o thyng he hym preyede outrely,	But one thing he him prayed earnestly,
That he to no wight, though men wolde enquere,	That he to no one, though men would inquire,
Sholde nat telle whos children that they were,	Should tell whose children they were,
But seye the mayden sholde ywedded be	But say the maiden should wedded be
Unto the Markys of Saluce anon.	Unto the Marquis of Saluce immediately.
And as this erl was preyed, so dide he;	And as this earl was asked, so did he;
For at day set he on his wey is goon	For at the set day he on his way is gone
Toward Saluce, and lordes many oon	Toward Saluce, and lords many a one
In riche array, this mayden for to gyde,	In rich array, this maiden to guide,
Hir yonge brother ridynge hire bisyde.	Her young brother riding beside her.
Arrayed was toward hir mariage	Adorned was in preparation for her marriage
This fresshe mayde, ful of gemmes cleere;	This lovely maid, (her clothing) full of bright gems;
Hir brother, which that seven yeer was of age,	Her brother, who was seven years of age,
	Arrayed eek ful fressh in his manere.
Adorned also full handsomely in his manner.	And thus in greet noblesse and with glad cheere,
And thus in great nobility and with a glad manner,	Toward Saluces shapynge hir journey,
Toward Saluces directing their journey,	Fro day to day they ryden in hir wey.
From day to day they ride on their way.	Among al this, after his wikke usage,
Meanwhile, in accord with his wicked usage,	This markys, yet his wyf to tempte moore
This marquis, yet his wife to test more	To the outtreste preeve of hir corage,
To the utmost test of her heart,	Fully to han experience and loore
Fully to have experience and knowledge	If that she were as stidefast as bifoore,
If she were as steadfast as before,	He on a day in open audience
He on a certain day in the hearing of all	Ful boistously hath seyd hire this sentence:
Full rudely has said to her this speech:	"Certes, Grisilde, I hadde ynogh plesance
"Certainly, Griselda, I had enough pleasure	To han yow to my wyf for youre goodnesse,
To have you as my wife for your goodness,	As for youre trouthe and for youre obeisance,
As for your truth and for your obedience	Noght for youre lynage, ne for youre richesse;
Not for your lineage, nor for your riches;	But now knowe I in verray soothfastnesse
But now know I in true certainty	That in greet lordshipe, if I wel avyse,
That in great lordship, if I judge rightly,	Ther is greet servitute in sondry wyse.
There is great servitude in various ways.	"I may nat doon as every plowman may.
"I can not do as every plowman may.	My peple me constreyneth for to take
My people constrain me to take	Another wyf, and crien day by day;
Another wife, and complain day by day;	And eek the pope, rancour for to slake,
And also the pope, to quench rancor,	Consenteth it -- that dar I undertake --
Consents to it -- that dare I assert --	And trewely thus muche I wol yow seye:
And truly thus much I will say to you:	My newe wyf is comynge by the weye.
My new wife is coming by the way.	"Be strong of herte, and voyde anon hir place;
"Be strong of heart, and vacate her place immediately;	And thilke dowere that ye broghten me,
And that dowry that you brought me,	Taak it agayn; I graunte it of my grace.
Take it back; I grant it of my grace.	Retourneth to youre fadres hous," quod he;
Return to your father's house," said he;	"No man may alwey han prosperitee.
"No one can always have prosperity.	With evene herte I rede yow t'endure
With tranquil heart I advise you to endure	The strook of Fortune or of aventure."
The stroke of Fortune or of chance."	And she agayn answerde in pacience:
And she in reply answered in patience:	"My lord," quod she, "I woot, and wiste alway,
"My lord," said she, "I know, and knew always,	How that bitwixen youre magnificence
How between your magnificence	And my poverte no wight kan ne may
And my poverty no person can nor may	Maken comparison; it is no nay.
Make comparison; it cannot be denied.	I ne heeld me nevere digne in no manere
I considered myself never worthy in any way	To be youre wyf, no, ne youre chamberere.
To be your wife, no, nor your chambermaid.	"And in this hous, ther ye me lady maade --
"And in this house, where you made me the lady --	The heighe God take I for my witnesse,
The high God I take for my witness,	And also wysly he my soule glaade --
And as surely as he my soul may gladden --	I nevere heeld me lady ne mistresse,
I never considered myself lady nor mistress,	But humble servant to youre worthynesse,
But humble servant to your worthiness,	And evere shal, whil that my lyf may dure,
And ever shall, while my life may endure,	Aboven every worldly creature.
Above every worldly creature.	"That ye so longe of youre benignitee
"That you so long of your benignity	Han holden me in honour and nobleye,
Have maintained me in honor and nobility,	Where as I was noght worthy for to bee,
Where I was not worthy to be,	That thonke I God and yow, to whom I preye
For that I thank you and God, to Whom I pray	Foryelde it yow; ther is namoore to seye.
To reward you for it; there is no more to say.	Unto my fader gladly wol I wende,
Unto my father gladly will I go,	And with hym dwelle unto my lyves ende.
And with him dwell unto my life's end.	"Ther I was fostred of a child ful smal,
"Where I was fostered as a child full small,	Til I be deed my lyf ther wol I lede,
Until I be dead I will lead my life there,	A wydwe clene in body, herte, and al.
A widow clean in body, heart, and all.	For sith I yaf to yow my maydenhede,
For since I gave to you my maidenhead,	And am youre trewe wyf, it is no drede,
And am your true wife, there is no doubt,	God shilde swich a lordes wyf to take
God forbid such a lord's wife to take	Another man to housbonde or to make!
Another man as husband or as mate!	"And of youre newe wyf God of his grace
"And of your new wife God of his grace	So graunte yow wele and prosperitee!
Grant you happiness and prosperity!	For I wol gladly yelden hire my place,
For I will gladly yield her my place,	In which that I was blisful wont to bee.
In which I was accustomed to be blissful.	For sith it liketh yow, my lord," quod shee,
For since it pleases you, my lord," said she,	"That whilom weren al myn hertes reste,
"Who once was all my heart's peace,	That I shal goon, I wol goon whan yow leste.
That I shall go, I will go when you please.	"But ther as ye me profre swich dowaire
"But inasmuch as you offer me such dowry	As I first broghte, it is wel in my mynde
As I first brought, it is well in my mind	It were my wrecched clothes, nothyng faire,
It was my wretched clothing, in no way fair,	The whiche to me were hard now for to fynde.
Which to me were hard to find now.	O goode God! How gentil and how kynde
O good God! How gentle and how kind	Ye semed by youre speche and youre visage
You seemed by your speech and your visage	The day that maked was oure mariage!
The day that our marriage was made!	"But sooth is seyd -- algate I fynde it trewe,
"But sooth is said -- always I find it true,	For in effect it preeved is on me --
For in fact it is proven by me --	Love is noght oold as whan that it is newe.
When love is old it is not the same as when it was new.	But certes, lord, for noon adversitee,
But certainly, lord, for no adversity,	To dyen in the cas, it shal nat bee
Even if I were to die miserably, it shall not be	That evere in word or werk I shal repente
That ever in word or deed I shall repent	That I yow yaf myn herte in hool entente.
That I gave you my heart whole heartedly.	"My lord, ye woot that in my fadres place
"My lord, you know that in my father's place	Ye dide me streepe out of my povre weede,
You had me stripped out of my poor clothing,	And richely me cladden, of youre grace.
And had me richly clad, by your grace.	To yow broghte I noght elles, out of drede,
To you I brought nothing else, beyond doubt,	But feith, and nakednesse, and maydenhede;
But faith, and nakedness, and maidenhead;	And heere agayn your clothyng I restoore,
And here in return your clothing I restore,	And eek your weddyng ryng, for everemore.
And also your wedding ring, for evermore.	"The remenant of youre jueles redy be
"The remnant of your jewels ready are	Inwith youre chambre, dar I saufly sayn.
Within your chamber, dare I confidently say.	Naked out of my fadres hous," quod she,
Naked out of my father's house," said she,	"I cam, and naked moot I turne agayn.
"I came, and naked must I return.	Al youre plesance wol I folwen fayn;
All your pleasure will I eagerly follow;	But yet I hope it be nat youre entente
But yet I hope it be not your intention	That I smoklees out of youre paleys wente.
That I should go without a smock out of your palace.	"Ye koude nat doon so dishonest a thyng,
"You could not do so shameful a thing,	That thilke wombe in which youre children leye
That that same womb in which your children lay	Sholde biforn the peple, in my walkyng,
Should before the people, in my walking,	Be seyn al bare; wherfore I yow preye,
Be seen all bare; therefore I you pray,	Lat me nat lyk a worm go by the weye.
Let me not like a worm go by the way.	Remembre yow, myn owene lord so deere,
Remember, my own lord so dear,	I was youre wyf, though I unworthy weere.
I was your wife, though I unworthy were.	"Wherfore, in gerdon of my maydenhede,
"Therefore, in recompense for my maidenhead,	Which that I broghte, and noght agayn I bere,
Which I brought, and nothing I bear back,	As voucheth sauf to yeve me, to my meede,
Condescend to give me, as my recompense,	But swich a smok as I was wont to were,
Only such a smock as I was accustomed to wear,	That I therwith may wrye the wombe of here
That I with it may cover the womb of her	That was youre wyf. And heer take I my leeve
Who was your wife. And here take I my leave	Of yow, myn owene lord, lest I yow greve."
Of you, my own lord, lest I you grieve."	"The smok," quod he, "that thou hast on thy bak,
"The smock," said he, "that thou hast on thy back,	Lat it be stille, and bere it forth with thee."
Let it be (there) still, and bear it forth with thee."	But wel unnethes thilke word he spak,
But scarcely that same word he spoke,	But wente his wey, for routhe and for pitee.
But went his way, for grief and for pity.	Biforn the folk hirselven strepeth she,
Before the folk she strips herself,	And in hir smok, with heed and foot al bare,
And in her smock, with head and foot all bare,	Toward hir fadre hous forth is she fare.
Toward her father's house forth is she gone.	The folk hire folwe, wepynge in hir weye,
The folk follow her, weeping on their way,	And Fortune ay they cursen as they goon;
And Fortune ever they curse as they go;	But she fro wepyng kepte hire eyen dreye,
But she from weeping kept her eyes dry,	Ne in this tyme word ne spak she noon.
And in this time no word she spoke.	Hir fader, that this tidynge herde anoon,
Her father, who heard this news straightway,	Curseth the day and tyme that Nature
Curses the day and time that Nature	Shoop hym to been a lyves creature.
Shaped him to be a living creature.	For out of doute this olde poure man
For doubtless this old poor man	Was evere in suspect of hir mariage;
Was ever in suspicion of her marriage;	For evere he demed, sith that it bigan,
For ever he believed, since it began,	That whan the lord fulfild hadde his corage,
That when the lord had fulfilled his desires,	Hym wolde thynke it were a disparage
He would think it was a degradation	To his estaat so lowe for t'alighte,
To his rank so low to stoop,	And voyden hire as soone as ever he myghte.
And get rid of her as soon as ever he could.	Agayns his doghter hastily goth he,
To meet his daughter hastily goes he,	For he by noyse of folk knew hire comynge,
For he by noise of folk knew her coming,	And with hire olde coote, as it myghte be
And with her old coat, insofar as it could	He covered hire, ful sorwefully wepynge.
He covered her, full sorrowfully weeping.	But on hire body myghte he it nat brynge,
But on her body he could not bring it,	For rude was the clooth, and moore of age
For coarse was the cloth, and more of age	By dayes fele than at hire mariage.
By many days than at her marriage.	Thus with hire fader for a certeyn space
Thus with her father for a certain space of time	Dwelleth this flour of wyfly pacience,
Dwells this flower of womanly patience,	That neither by hire wordes ne hire face,
That neither by her words nor her face,	Biforn the folk, ne eek in hire absence,
Before the folk, nor also in their absence,	Ne shewed she that hire was doon offence;
She showed that to her was done offence;	Ne of hire heighe estaat no remembraunce
Nor of her high estate no remembrance	Ne hadde she, as by hire contenaunce.
Had she, according to her countenance.	No wonder is, for in hire grete estaat
No wonder is, for in her great estate	Hire goost was evere in pleyn humylitee;
Her spirit was ever in full humility;	No tendre mouth, noon herte delicaat,
No tender mouth, no self-indulgent feelings,	No pompe, no semblant of roialtee,
No pomp, nor outward appearance of royalty,	But ful of pacient benyngnytee,
But full of patient goodness,	Discreet and pridelees, ay honurable,
Discreet and without pride, ever honorable,	And to hire housbonde evere meke and stable.
And to her husband ever meek and stable.	Men speke of Job, and moost for his humblesse,
Men speak of Job, and mostly for his humility,	As clerkes, whan hem list, konne wel endite,
As clerks, when they want, know well how to write,	Namely of men, but as in soothfastnesse,
Especially of men, but in truth,	Though clerkes preise wommen but a lite,
Though clerks praise women but a little,	Ther kan no man in humblesse hym acquite
There can no man in humility acquit himself	As womman kan, ne kan been half so trewe
As woman can, nor can be half so true	As wommen been, but it be falle of newe.
As women are, unless it happened recently.	Fro Boloigne is this Erl of Panyk come,
From Bologna is this Earl of Panyk come,	Of which the fame up sprang to moore and lesse,
Of which the news up sprang to high ranks and low,	And to the peples eres, alle and some,
And to the people's ears, one and all,	Was kouth eek that a newe markysesse
Was made known also that a new marchioness	He with hym broghte, in swich pompe and richesse
He brought with him, in such pomp and riches	That nevere was ther seyn with mannes ye
That never was there seen with man's eye	So noble array in al West Lumbardye.
Such a noble array in all West Lombardy.	The markys, which that shoop and knew al this,
The marquis, who arranged and knew all this,	Er that this erl was come, sente his message
Before this earl was come, sent his messenger	For thilke sely povre Grisildis;
For that same innocent poor Griselda;	And she with humble herte and glad visage,
And she with humble heart and glad visage,	Nat with no swollen thoght in hire corage,
Not with any proud thought in her heart,	Cam at his heste, and on hire knees hire sette,
Came at his command, and on her knees set herself,	And reverently and wisely she hym grette.
And reverently and wisely she greeted him.	"Grisilde," quod he, "my wyl is outrely
"Griselda," said he, "my will is completely	This mayden, that shal wedded been to me,
That this maiden, who shall be wedded to me,	Received be to-morwe as roially
Be received to-morrow as royally	As it possible is in myn hous to be,
As it is possible in my house to be,	And eek that every wight in his degree
And also that every person, according to his rank	Have his estaat, in sittyng and servyse
Have his due respect, in seating and service	And heigh plesaunce, as I kan best devyse.
And great pleasure, as I can best arrange.	"I have no wommen suffisaunt, certayn,
"I have no women capable, certainly,	The chambres for t'arraye in ordinaunce
The chambers to put in order	After my lust, and therfore wolde I fayn
According to my wishes, and therefore I would like	That thyn were al swich manere governaunce.
That thine be the supervision of all this business.	Thou knowest eek of old al my plesaunce;
Thou knowest also of old all my desires;	Thogh thyn array be badde and yvel biseye,
Though thy dress be bad and in poor condition,	Do thou thy devoir at the leeste weye."
Do thou thy duty at least."	"Nat oonly, lord, that I am glad," quod she,
"Not only, lord, I am glad," said she,	"To doon youre lust, but I desire also
"To do your wishes, but I desire also	Yow for to serve and plese in my degree
You to serve and please in accord with my rank	Withouten feyntyng, and shal everemo;
Without weakening, and shall evermore;	Ne nevere, for no wele ne no wo,
Nor never, for any happiness nor any woe,	Ne shal the goost withinne myn herte stente
Shall the spirit within my heart cease	To love yow best with al my trewe entente."
To love you best with all my true will."	And with that word she gan the hous to dighte,
And with that word she began to prepare the house,	And tables for to sette, and beddes make;
And to set tables, and make beds;	And peyned hire to doon al that she myghte,
And took pains to do all that she could,	Preyynge the chambereres, for Goddes sake,
Praying the chambermaids, for God's sake,	To hasten hem, and faste swepe and shake;
To hasten themselves, and fast sweep and dust;	And she, the mooste servysable of alle,
And she, the most willing to serve of all,	Hath every chambre arrayed and his halle.
Has every chamber prepared and his hall.	Abouten undren gan this erl alighte,
About mid-morning did this earl alight,	That with hym broghte thise noble children tweye,
Who with him brought these noble children two,	For which the peple ran to seen the sighte
For which the people ran to see the sight	Of hire array, so richely biseye;
Of their accoutrements, so rich in appearance;	And thanne at erst amonges hem they seye
And then for the first time amongst themselves they say	That Walter was no fool, thogh that hym leste
That Walter was no fool, though he desired	To chaunge his wyf, for it was for the beste.
To change his wife, for it was for the best.	For she is fairer, as they deemen alle,
For she is fairer, as they all decide,	Than is Grisilde, and moore tendre of age,
Than is Griselda, and more tender of age,	And fairer fruyt bitwene hem sholde falle,
And fairer fruit between them should fall,	And moore plesant, for hire heigh lynage.
And more pleasing, because of her high lineage.	Hir brother eek so fair was of visage
Her brother also so fair was of visage	That hem to seen the peple hath caught plesaunce,
That the people take pleasure in seeing them,	Commendynge now the markys governaunce.
Commending now the marquis's governance.	"O stormy peple! Unsad and evere untrewe!
"O stormy people! Inconstant and ever untrue!	Ay undiscreet and chaungynge as a fane!
Ever undiscerning and changing like a weather vane!	Delitynge evere in rumbul that is newe,
Delighting ever in rumor that is new,	For lyk the moone ay wexe ye and wane!
For like the moon ever you wax and wane!	Ay ful of clappyng, deere ynogh a jane!
Always full of chattering, not worth a penny!	Youre doom is fals, youre constance yvele preeveth;
Your judgment is false, your constancy proves evil;	A ful greet fool is he that on yow leeveth."
A full great fool is he that believes in you."	Thus seyden sadde folk in that citee,
Thus said serious folk in that city,	Whan that the peple gazed up and doun,
When the people gazed up and down,	For they were glad, right for the noveltee,
For they were glad, right for the novelty,	To han a newe lady of hir toun.
To have a new lady of their town.	Namoore of this make I now mencioun,
No more of this make I now mention,	But to Grisilde agayn wol I me dresse,
But to Griselda again will I address myself,	And telle hir constance and hir bisynesse.
And tell her constancy and her diligence.	Ful bisy was Grisilde in every thyng
Full busy was Griselda in every thing	That to the feeste was apertinent.
That was pertaining to the feast.	Right noght was she abayst of hire clothyng,
Not at all was she ashamed of her clothing,	Thogh it were rude and somdeel eek torent;
Though it was crude and also somewhat ragged;	But with glad cheere to the yate is went
But with glad manner to the gate is went	With oother folk to greete the markysesse,
With other folk to greet the marchioness,	And after that dooth forth hire bisynesse.
And after that carries on her work.	With so glad chiere his gestes she receyveth,
With such glad manner his guests she receives,	And so konnyngly, everich in his degree,
And so skillfully, each according to his rank,	That no defaute no man aperceyveth,
That no man perceives any fault,	But ay they wondren what she myghte bee
But ever they wonder who she might be	That in so povre array was for to see,
That in such poor array was to be seen,	And koude swich honour and reverence,
And knew how to do such honor and reverence,	And worthily they preisen hire prudence.
And deservedly they praise her prudence.	In al this meene while she ne stente
In all this mean while she did not cease	This mayde and eek hir brother to commende
This maid and also her brother to commend	With al hir herte, in ful benyngne entente,
With all her heart, in full benign intention,	So wel that no man koude hir pris amende.
So well that no man could praise her more highly.	But atte laste, whan that thise lordes wende
But at the last, when these lords went	To sitten doun to mete, he gan to calle
To sit down to dinner, he called	Grisilde, as she was bisy in his halle.
Griselda, as she was busy in his hall.	"Grisilde," quod he, as it were in his pley,
"Griselda," said he, as if it were a joke,	"How liketh thee my wyf and hire beautee?"
"How do you like my wife and her beauty?"	"Right wel," quod she, "my lord; for, in good fey,
"Right well," said she, "my lord; for, in good faith,	A fairer saugh I nevere noon than she.
I never saw so fair a one as she.	I prey to God yeve hire prosperitee;
I pray to God to give her prosperity;	And so hope I that he wol to yow sende
And so I hope that he will to you send	Plesance ynogh unto youre lyves ende.
Pleasure enough unto your lives' end.	"O thyng biseke I yow, and warne also,
"One thing I beseech you, and warn also,	That ye ne prikke with no tormentynge
That you not distress with any tormenting	This tendre mayden, as ye han doon mo;
This tender maiden, as you have done to others;	For she is fostred in hire norissynge
For she has been reared in her nurture	Moore tendrely, and, to my supposynge,
More tenderly, and, as I believe,	She koude nat adversitee endure
She could not endure adversity	As koude a povre fostred creature."
As could a poorly reared creature."	And whan this Walter saugh hire pacience,
And when this Walter saw her patience,	Hir glade chiere, and no malice at al,
Her glad expression, and no malice at all,	And he so ofte had doon to hire offence,
And he so often had done to her offence,	And she ay sad and constant as a wal,
And she ever steadfast and constant as a wall,	Continuynge evere hire innocence overal,
Continuing ever her innocence in every way,	This sturdy markys gan his herte dresse
This stern marquis inclined his heart	To rewen upon hire wyfly stedfastnesse.
To have pity upon her womanly steadfastness.	"This is ynogh, Grisilde myn," quod he;
"This is enough, Griselda mine," said he;	"Be now namoore agast ne yvele apayed.
"Be now no more frightened nor displeased.	I have thy feith and thy benyngnytee,
I have thy faith and thy goodness,	As wel as evere womman was, assayed,
As well as ever woman was, tested,	In greet estaat and povreliche arrayed.
In great estate and in poverty.	Now knowe I, dere wyf, thy stedfastnesse" --
Now I know, dear wife, thy steadfastness" --	And hire in armes took and gan hire kesse.
And took her in arms and kissed her.	And she for wonder took of it no keep;
And she for amazement took of it no notice;	She herde nat what thyng he to hire seyde;
She heard not what thing he said to her;	She ferde as she had stert out of a sleep,
She fared as if she had suddenly awakened out of a sleep,	Til she out of hire mazednesse abreyde.
Until out of her bewilderment she suddenly awoke.	"Grisilde," quod he, "by God, that for us deyde,
"Griselda," said he, "by God, who for us died,	Thou art my wyf, ne noon oother I have,
Thou art my wife, and none other I have,	Ne nevere hadde, as God my soule save!
Nor ever had, as God my soul may save!	"This is thy doghter, which thou hast supposed
"This is thy daughter, which thou hast supposed	To be my wyf; that oother feithfully
To be my wife; that other truly	Shal be myn heir, as I have ay disposed;
Shall be my heir, as I have ever intended;	Thou bare hym in thy body trewely.
Thou bore him in thy body truly.	At Boloigne have I kept hem prively;
At Bologna I have kept them secretly;	Taak hem agayn, for now maystow nat seye
Take them back, for now mayst thou not say	That thou hast lorn noon of thy children tweye.
That thou hast lost any of thy children two.	"And folk that ootherweys han seyd of me,
"And folk that otherwise have said of me,	I warne hem wel that I have doon this deede
I declare to them clearly that I have done this deed	For no malice, ne for no crueltee,
For no malice, nor for no cruelty,	But for t'assaye in thee thy wommanheede,
But to test in thee thy womanhood,	And nat to sleen my children -- God forbeede! --
And not to slay my children -- God forbid! --	But for to kepe hem pryvely and stille,
But to keep them secretly and quietly,	Til I thy purpos knewe and al thy wille."
Until I knew thy perseverence and all thy will."	Whan she this herde, aswowne doun she falleth
When she heard this, down she falls in a swoon	For pitous joye, and after hire swownynge
For pitiful joy, and after her swooning	She bothe hire yonge children to hire calleth,
She calls both her young children to her,	And in hire armes, pitously wepynge,
And in her arms, pitifully weeping,	Embraceth hem, and tendrely kissynge
Embraces them, and tenderly kissing	Ful lyk a mooder, with hire salte teeres
Full like a mother, with her salt tears	She bathed bothe hire visage and hire heeres.
She bathed both their visage and their hair.	O which a pitous thyng it was to se
O what a pathetic thing it was to see	Hir swownyng, and hire humble voys to heere!
Her swooning, and her humble voice to hear!	"Grauntmercy, lord, God thanke it yow," quod she,
"Great thanks, lord, may God repay it to you," said she,	"That ye han saved me my children deere!
"That you have saved for me my children dear!	Now rekke I nevere to been deed right heere;
Now care I never to be dead right here;	Sith I stonde in youre love and in youre grace,
Since I stand in your love and in your grace,	No fors of deeth, ne whan my spirit pace!
Death does not matter, nor when my spirit may pass (away)!	"O tendre, o deere, o yonge children myne!
"O tender, o dear, o my young children!	Youre woful mooder wende stedfastly
Your woeful mother truly believed	That crueel houndes or som foul vermyne
That cruel hounds or some foul animal pests	Hadde eten yow; but God of his mercy
Had eaten you; but God of his mercy	And youre benyngne fader tendrely
And your benign father tenderly	Hath doon yow kept" -- and in that same stounde
Has had you protected" -- and in that same moment	Al sodeynly she swapte adoun to grounde.
All suddenly she fell down to the ground.	And in hire swough so sadly holdeth she
And in her swoon so tightly holds she	Hire children two, whan she gan hem t'embrace,
Her children two, when she embraced them,	That with greet sleighte and greet difficultee
That with great effort and great difficulty	The children from hire arm they gonne arace.
The children from her arm they did tear away.	O many a teere on many a pitous face
O many a tear on many a pitiful face	Doun ran of hem that stooden hire bisyde;
Down ran of them that stood beside her;	Unnethe abouten hire myghte they abyde.
Hardly about her might they remain.	Walter hire gladeth and hire sorwe slaketh;
Walter comforts her and her sorrow relieves;	She riseth up, abaysed, from hire traunce,
She rises up, disconcerted, from her trance,	And every wight hire joye and feeste maketh
And every person makes joy and festivity for her	Til she hath caught agayn hire contenaunce.
Until she has regained her composure.	Walter hire dooth so feithfully plesaunce
Walter strives so faithfully to please her	That it was deyntee for to seen the cheere
That it was delightful to see the happiness	Bitwixe hem two, now they been met yfeere.
Between them two, now they are met together.	Thise ladyes, whan that they hir tyme say,
These ladies, when they see their time,	Han taken hire and into chambre gon,
Have taken her and into chamber they go,	And strepen hire out of hire rude array,
And strip her out of her crude clothing,	And in a clooth of gold that brighte shoon,
And in a cloth of gold that brightly shone,	With a coroune of many a riche stoon
With a crown of many a rich stone	Upon hire heed, they into halle hire broghte,
Upon her head, they into hall her brought,	And ther she was honured as hire oghte.
And there she was honored as she deserved.	Thus hath this pitous day a blisful ende,
Thus has this pitiful day a blissful end,	For every man and womman dooth his myght
For every man and woman does his might	This day in murthe and revel to dispende
This day in mirth and revel to spend	Til on the welkne shoon the sterres lyght.
Until in the sky shone the stars' light.	For moore solempne in every mannes syght
For more splendid in every man's sight	This feste was, and gretter of costage,
This feast was, and greater of cost,	Than was the revel of hire mariage.
Than was the revel of their marriage.	Ful many a yeer in heigh prosperitee
Full many a year in high prosperity	Lyven thise two in concord and in reste,
Live these two in peace and in quiet,	And richely his doghter maryed he
And richly his daughter married he	Unto a lord, oon of the worthieste
Unto a lord, one of the worthiest	Of al Ytaille; and thanne in pees and reste
Of all Italy; and then in peace and rest	His wyves fader in his court he kepeth,
His wife's father in his court he keeps,	Til that the soule out of his body crepeth.
Until the soul out of his body creeps.	His sone succedeth in his heritage
His son succeeds in his heritage	In reste and pees, after his fader day,
In rest and peace, after his father's day,	And fortunat was eek in mariage,
And fortunate was also in marriage,	Al putte he nat his wyf in greet assay.
Although he put not his wife in great tests.	This world is nat so strong, it is no nay,
This world is not so strong, there is no denying,	As it hath been in olde tymes yoore,
As it has been in old times long ago,	And herkneth what this auctour seith therfoore.
And listen to what this author says concerning this (tale).	This storie is seyd nat for that wyves sholde
This story is said not so that wives should	Folwen Grisilde as in humylitee,
Follow Griselda in humility,	For it were inportable, though they wolde,
For it would be intolerable, though they would (want to),	But for that every wight, in his degree,
But so that every person, in his station in life,	Sholde be constant in adversitee
Should be constant in adversity	As was Grisilde; therfore Petrak writeth
As was Griselda; therefore Petrarch writes	This storie, which with heigh stile he enditeth.
This story, which with high style he composes.	For sith a womman was so pacient
For since a woman was so patient	Unto a mortal man, wel moore us oghte
Unto a mortal man, well more we ought to	Receyven al in gree that God us sent;
Receive with a good will all that God sends us;	For greet skile is he preeve that he wroghte.
For it is very reasonable that he test what he made.	But he ne tempteth no man that he boghte,
But he tests no man that he redeemed,	As seith Seint Jame, if ye his pistel rede;
As says Saint James, if you his epistle read;	He preeveth folk al day, it is no drede,
He tests folk all the time, it is no doubt,	And suffreth us, as for oure excercise,
And permits us, for our own good	With sharpe scourges of adversitee
With sharp whips of adversity	Ful ofte to be bete in sondry wise;
Full often to be beaten in various ways;	Nat for to knowe oure wyl, for certes he,
Not to know our will, for certainly he,	Er we were born, knew al oure freletee;
Before we were born, knew all our frailty;	And for oure beste is al his governaunce.
And for our best is all his governance.	Lat us thanne lyve in vertuous suffraunce.
Let us then live in virtuous forbearance.	But o word, lordynges, herkneth er I go:
But one word, lords, hear before I go:	It were ful hard to fynde now-a-dayes
It would be very difficult to find now-a-days	In al a toun Grisildis thre or two;
In all the town Griseldas three or two;	For if that they were put to swiche assayes,
For if they were put to such tests,	The gold of hem hath now so badde alayes
The gold of them has now been so badly debased	With bras, that thogh the coyne be fair at ye,
With brass, that though the coin be fair to look at,	It wolde rather breste a-two than plye.
It would rather break in two than bend.	For which heere, for the Wyves love of Bathe --
For which here, for the love of the Wife of Bath --	Whos lyf and al hire secte God mayntene
Whose life and all her sect may God maintain	In heigh maistrie, and elles were it scathe --
In high mastery, and otherwise it would be a pity --	I wol with lusty herte, fressh and grene,
I will with lusty heart, fresh and vigorous,	Seyn yow a song to glade yow, I wene;
Say you a song to make you happy, I believe;	And lat us stynte of ernestful matere.
And let us stint of serious matter.	Herkneth my song that seith in this manere:
Hear my song that says in this manner:	Lenvoy de Chaucer.
Chaucer's envoy.	Grisilde is deed, and eek hire pacience,
Griselda is dead, and also her patience,	And bothe atones buryed in Ytaille;
And both together buried in Italy;	For which I crie in open audience
For which I cry in the hearing of all	No wedded man so hardy be t'assaille
No wedded man so bold be to test	His wyves pacience in trust to fynde
His wife's patience trusting to find	Grisildis, for in certein he shal faille.
Griselda, for certainly he shall faille.	O noble wyves, ful of heigh prudence,
O noble wives, full of great prudence,	Lat noon humylitee youre tonge naille,
Let no humility nail down your tongue,	Ne lat no clerk have cause or diligence
Nor let any clerk have cause or eagerness	To write of yow a storie of swich mervaille
To write about you a story of such marvel	As of Grisildis pacient and kynde,
As of patient and kind Griselda,	Lest Chichevache yow swelwe in hire entraille!
Lest Chichevache swallow you in her entrails!	Folweth Ekko, that holdeth no silence,
Follow Echo, who holds no silence,	But evere answereth at the countretaille.
But ever answers in reply.	Beth nat bidaffed for youre innocence,
Be not fooled because of your innocence,	But sharply taak on yow the governaille.
But eagerly take the governance to yourself.	Emprenteth wel this lessoun in youre mynde,
Imprint well this lesson in your mind,	For commune profit sith it may availle.
Since it may work to the benefit of all.	Ye archewyves, stondeth at defense,
You arch-wives, stand ready for battle,	Syn ye be strong as is a greet camaille;
Since you are strong as is a great camel;	Ne suffreth nat that men yow doon offense.
Suffer not that men do offense to you.	And sklendre wyves, fieble as in bataille,
And slender wives, feeble in battle,	Beth egre as is a tygre yond in Ynde;
Be fierce as is a tiger yonder in India;	Ay clappeth as a mille, I yow consaille.
Ever wag your tongues like a windmill, I you advise.	Ne dreed hem nat; doth hem no reverence,
Fear them not; do them no reverence,	For though thyn housbonde armed be in maille,
For though thy husband be armed in mail,	The arwes of thy crabbed eloquence
The arrows of thy spiteful eloquence	Shal perce his brest and eek his aventaille.
Shall pierce his breast and also his neck-guard.	In jalousie I rede eek thou hym bynde,
In jealousy I advise also that thou bind him,	And thou shalt make hym couche as doth a quaille.
And thou shalt make him cower as does a quail.	If thou be fair, ther folk been in presence,
If thou be fair, where folk are present,	Shewe thou thy visage and thyn apparaille;
Show thou thy visage and thy apparel;	If thou be foul, be fre of thy dispence;
If thou be ugly, be lavish in thy expenditures;	To gete thee freendes ay do thy travaille;
To get thee friends always work hard;	Be ay of chiere as light as leef on lynde,
Be ever in behavior as light as a leaf on a linden tree,	And lat hym care, and wepe, and wrynge, and waille!
And let him grieve, and weep, and wring his hands, and wail!	Bihoold the murye words of the Host

Oure Hooste seyde, and swoor, "By Goddes bones,	Our Host said, and swore, "By God's bones,

My wyf at hoom had herd this legende ones!	My wife at home had heard this legend once!
This is a gentil tale for the nones,	This is a fine tale for this occasion,
As to my purpos, wiste ye my wille;	For my purposes, if you knew my will;
But thyng that wol nat be, lat it be stille."	But thing that will not be, let it be still."

"Hoo!" quod the Knyght, "good sire, namoore of this!	"Whoa!" said the Knight, "good sire, no more of this!
That ye han seyd is right ynough, ywis,	What you have said is quite enough, indeed,
And muchel moore; for litel hevynesse	And much more; for a little sadness
Is right ynough to muche folk, I gesse.	Is quite enough for many people, I guess.
I seye for me, it is a greet disese,	I say for myself, it is a great distress,
Whereas men han been in greet welthe and ese,	When men have been in great wealth and ease,
To heeren of hire sodeyn fal, allas!	To hear of their sudden fall, alas!
And the contrarie is joye and greet solas,	And the contrary is joy and great comfort,
As whan a man hath been in povre estaat,	As when a man has been in a poor condition,
And clymbeth up and wexeth fortunat,	And climbs up and becomes fortunate,
And there abideth in prosperitee.	And there remains in prosperity.
Swich thyng is gladsom, as it thynketh me,	Such a thing is pleasing, as it seems to me,
And of swich thyng were goodly for to telle."	And of such a thing it would be good to tell."
"Ye," quod oure Hooste, "by Seint Poules belle!	"Yea," said our Host, "by Saint Paul's bell!
Ye seye right sooth; this Monk he clappeth lowde.	You say the very truth; this Monk he chatters noisily.
He spak how Fortune covered with a clowde	He spoke of how Fortune covered with a cloud
I noot nevere what; and als of a tragedie	I know not what; and also of a tragedy
Right now ye herde, and pardee, no remedie	Just now you heard, and by God, no remedy
It is for to biwaille ne compleyne	Is it to bewail or lament
That that is doon, and als it is a peyne,	That which is done, and also it is a pain,
As ye han seyd, to heere of hevynesse.	As you have said, to hear of sadness.
"Sire Monk, namoore of this, so God yow blesse!	"Sir Monk, no more of this, as God may you bless!
Youre tale anoyeth al this compaignye.	Your tale annoys all this company.
Swich talkyng is nat worth a boterflye,	Such talking is not worth a butterfly,
For therinne is ther no desport ne game.	For in it there is no pleasure nor amusement.
Wherfore, sire Monk, daun Piers by youre name,	Therefore, Sir Monk, dan Piers by your name,
I pray yow hertely telle us somwhat elles;	I pray yow earnestly tell us something else;
For sikerly, nere clynkyng of youre belles	For truly, were it not for the clinking of your bells
That on youre bridel hange on every syde,	That on your bridle hang on every side,
By hevene kyng that for us alle dyde,	By heaven's King who for us all died,
I sholde er this han fallen doun for sleep,	I should before this have fallen down because of sleepiness,
Althogh the slough had never been so deep;	Although the mud had never been so deep;
Thanne hadde your tale al be toold in veyn.	Then had your tale been told all in vain.
For certeinly, as that thise clerkes seyn,	For certainly, as these clerks say,
Whereas a man may have noon audience,	Where a man may have no hearers,
Noght helpeth it to tellen his sentence.	It is no use to tell his opinion.
"And wel I woot the substance is in me,	"And well I know the capacity of appreciation is in me,
If any thyng shal wel reported be.	If any thing shall be well told.
Sir, sey somwhat of huntyng, I yow preye."	Sir, say something about hunting, I you pray."
"Nay," quod this Monk, "I have no lust to pleye.	"Nay," said this Monk, "I have no desire to play.
Now lat another telle, as I have toold."	Now let another tell, as I have told."
Thanne spak oure Hoost with rude speche and boold,	Then spoke oure Host with rude speech and bold,
And seyde unto the Nonnes Preest anon,	And said unto the Nun's Priest straightway,
"Com neer, thou preest, com hyder, thou sir John!	"Come near, thou priest, come hither, thou sir John!
Telle us swich thyng as may oure hertes glade.	Tell us such thing as may our hearts gladden.
Be blithe, though thou ryde upon a jade.	Be happy, though thou ride upon a nag.
What thogh thyn hors be bothe foul and lene?	What if thy horse be both poor and lean?
If he wol serve thee, rekke nat a bene.	If he will serve thee, care not a bean.
Looke that thyn herte be murie everemo."	See that thy heart be merry evermore."
"Yis, sir," quod he, "yis, Hoost, so moot I go,	"Yes indeed, sir," said he, "yes indeed, Host, as I may I prosper,
But I be myrie, ywis I wol be blamed."	Unless I be merry, indeed I will be blamed."
And right anon his tale he hath attamed,	And right away his tale he has begun,
And thus he seyde unto us everichon,	And thus he said unto us every one,
This sweete preest, this goodly man sir John.	This sweet priest, this goodly man sir John.
A povre wydwe, somdeel stape in age,	A poor widow, somewhat advanced in age,
Was whilom dwellyng in a narwe cotage,	Was once dwelling in a small cottage,
Biside a grove, stondynge in a dale.	Beside a grove, standing in a dale.
This wydwe, of which I telle yow my tale,	This widow, of whom I tell you my tale,
Syn thilke day that she was last a wyf	Since that same day that she was last a wife
In pacience ladde a ful symple lyf,	In patience led a very simple life,
For litel was hir catel and hir rente.	For little was her possessions and her income.
By housbondrie of swich as God hire sente	By husbandry of such as God sent her
She foond hirself and eek hir doghtren two.	She provided for herself and also her two daughters.
Thre large sowes hadde she, and namo,	She had three large sows, and no more,
Three keen, and eek a sheep that highte Malle.	Three cows, and also a sheep that is called Malle.
Ful sooty was hire bour and eek hir halle,	Full sooty was her bedchamber and also her hall,
In which she eet ful many a sklendre meel.	In which she ate very many a scanty meal.
Of poynaunt sauce hir neded never a deel.	She needed not a bit of spicy sauce.
No deyntee morsel passed thurgh hir throte;	No dainty morsel passed through her throat;
Hir diete was accordant to hir cote.	Her diet was such as her farm produced.
Repleccioun ne made hire nevere sik;	Overeating never made her sick;
Attempree diete was al hir phisik,	Moderate diet was all her medical treatment,
And exercise, and hertes suffisaunce.	And exercise, and a contented heart.
The goute lette hire nothyng for to daunce,	The gout not at all prevented her from dancing,
N' apoplexie shente nat hir heed.	And apoplexy harmed not her head.
No wyn ne drank she, neither whit ne reed;	No wine she drank, neither white nor red;
Hir bord was served moost with whit and blak --	Her board was provided mostly with white and black --
Milk and broun breed, in which she foond no lak,	Milk and dark bread, in which she found no lack,
Seynd bacoun, and somtyme an ey or tweye,	Broiled bacon, and sometimes an egg or two,
For she was, as it were, a maner deye.	For she was, as it were, a sort of dairywoman.
A yeerd she hadde, enclosed al aboute	She had a yard, enclosed all around
With stikkes, and a drye dych withoute,	With sticks, and a dry ditch outside it,
In which she hadde a cok, hight Chauntecleer.	In which she had a cock, called Chauntecleer.
In al the land, of crowyng nas his peer.	In all the land, there was not his peer in crowing.
His voys was murier than the murie orgon	His voice was merrier than the merry organ
On messe-dayes that in the chirche gon.	That goes in the church on mass-days.
Wel sikerer was his crowyng in his logge	Well more accurate was his crowing in his lodge
Than is a clokke or an abbey orlogge.	Than is a clock or an abbey timepiece.
By nature he knew ech ascencioun	By nature he knew (the hour of) each ascension
Of the equynoxial in thilke toun;	Of the celestial equator in that same town;
For whan degrees fiftene weren ascended,	For when degrees fifteen were ascended,
Thanne crew he that it myghte nat been amended.	Then he crowed so that it could not be improved.
His coomb was redder than the fyn coral,	His comb was redder than the fine coral,
And batailled as it were a castel wal;	And notched with battlements as if it were a castle wall;
His byle was blak, and as the jeet it shoon;	His bill was black, and it shone like the jet stone;
Lyk asure were his legges and his toon;	Like azure were his legs and his toes;
His nayles whitter than the lylye flour,	His nails whiter than the lily flour,
And lyk the burned gold was his colour.	And like the burnished gold was his color.
This gentil cok hadde in his governaunce	This gentle cock had in his governance
Sevene hennes for to doon al his plesaunce,	Seven hens to do all his pleasure,
Whiche were his sustres and his paramours,	Which were his sisters and his concubines,
And wonder lyk to hym, as of colours;	And wonderfully like him, in their colors;
Of whiche the faireste hewed on hir throte	Of which the fairest colored on her throat
Was cleped faire damoysele Pertelote.	Was called fair demoiselle Pertelote.
Curteys she was, discreet, and debonaire,	Courteous she was, discreet, and gracious,
And compaignable, and bar hyrself so faire	And companionable, and bore herself so fair
Syn thilke day that she was seven nyght oold	Since that same day that she was seven nights old
That trewely she hath the herte in hoold	That truly she has in possession the heart
Of Chauntecleer, loken in every lith;	Of Chauntecleer, locked in every limb (completely);
He loved hire so that wel was hym therwith.	He loved her so that well was him because of that.
But swich a joye was it to here hem synge,	But such a joy it was to hear them sing,
Whan that the brighte sonne gan to sprynge,	When the bright sun began to spring,
In sweete accord, "My lief is faren in londe!" --	In sweet accord, "My love has gone to the country!" --
For thilke tyme, as I have understonde,	For in that same time, as I have understood,
Beestes and briddes koude speke and synge.	Beasts and birds could speak and sing.
And so bifel that in a dawenynge,	And so befell that in a dawning,
As Chauntecleer among his wyves alle	As Chauntecleer among all his wives
Sat on his perche, that was in the halle,	Sat on his perch, that was in the hall,
And next hym sat this faire Pertelote,	And next to him sat this faire Pertelote,
This Chauntecleer gan gronen in his throte,	This Chauntecleer began to groan in his throat,
As man that in his dreem is drecched soore.	As one that in his dream is deeply troubled.
And whan that Pertelote thus herde hym roore,	And when Pertelote thus heard him roar,
She was agast and seyde, "Herte deere,	She was aghast and said, "Dear heart,
What eyleth yow, to grone in this manere?	What ails you, to groan in this manner?
Ye been a verray sleper; fy, for shame!"	You are a true (sound) sleeper; fie, for shame!"
And he answerde, and seyde thus: "Madame,	And he answered, and said thus: "Madame,
I pray yow that ye take it nat agrief.	I pray you that you take it not amiss.
By God, me mette I was in swich meschief	By God, I dreamed I was in such mischief
Right now that yet myn herte is soore afright.	Right now that yet my heart is grievously frightened.
Now God," quod he, "my swevene recche aright,	Now God," said he, "interpret my dream correctly,

To walken in the yerd upon that morwe	To walk in the yard upon that morning

Passe over, for I seyde it in my game.	Pass over, for I said it as a joke.
Rede auctours, where they trete of swich mateere,	Read authors, where they treat of such matter,
And what they seyn of wommen ye may heere.	And what they say of women you may hear.
Thise been the cokkes wordes, and nat myne;	These are the cock's words, and not mine;
I kan noon harm of no womman divyne.	I know no harm of any woman divine.
Faire in the soond, to bathe hire myrily,	Fair in the sand, to bathe her merrily,

Soong murier than the mermayde in the see	Sang more merrily than the mermaid in the sea
(For Phisiologus seith sikerly	(For Phisiologus says surely
How that they syngen wel and myrily).	How they sing well and merrily).
And so bifel that, as he caste his ye	And so befell that, as he cast his eye
Among the wortes on a boterflye,	On a butterfly among the cabbages,
He was war of this fox, that lay ful lowe.	He was aware of this fox, that lay very low.
Nothyng ne liste hym thanne for to crowe,	Not at all then did he want to crow,
But cride anon, "Cok! cok!" and up he sterte	But cried straightway, "Cock! cock!" and up he leaped
As man that was affrayed in his herte.	As one that was frightened in his heart.
For natureelly a beest desireth flee	For naturally a beast desires to flee
Fro his contrarie, if he may it see,	From his natural opponent, if he may see it,

He wolde han fled, but that the fox anon	He would have fled, but that the fox straightway
Seyde, "Gentil sire, allas, wher wol ye gon?	Said, "Gentle sir, alas, where will you go?
Be ye affrayed of me that am youre freend?	Are you afraid of me who is your friend?

Han in myn hous ybeen to my greet ese;	Have been in my house to my great pleasure;
And certes, sire, ful fayn wolde I yow plese.	And certainly, sir, I would very eagerly please you.
But, for men speke of syngyng, I wol seye --	But, insofar as men speak of singing, I will say --
So moote I brouke wel myne eyen tweye --	As I may well have use of my two eyes --
Save yow, I herde nevere man so synge	Except for you, I heard never man so sing
As dide youre fader in the morwenynge.	As did your father in the morning.
Certes, it was of herte, al that he song.	Certainly, it came from the heart, all that he sang.
And for to make his voys the moore strong,	And to make his voice the more strong,
He wolde so peyne hym that with bothe his yen	He would so exert himself that with both his eyes

And stonden on his tiptoon therwithal,	And stand on his tiptoes simultaneously,
And strecche forth his nekke long and smal.	And stretch forth his neck long and small.
And eek he was of swich discrecioun	And also he was of such sound judgment
That ther nas no man in no regioun	That there was no man in any region
That hym in song or wisedom myghte passe.	That might pass him in song or wisdom.
I have wel rad in `Daun Burnel the Asse,'	I have well read in `Dan Burnel the Ass,'
Among his vers, how that ther was a cok,	Among his verses, how there was a cock,
For that a preestes sone yaf hym a knok	Because a priest's son gave him a knock
Upon his leg whil he was yong and nyce,	Upon his leg while he was young and foolish,
He made hym for to lese his benefice.	He made him lose his benefice.
But certeyn, ther nys no comparisoun	But certainly, there is no comparison

Now syngeth, sire, for seinte charitee;	Now sing, sir, for Saint Charity;
Lat se; konne ye youre fader countrefete?"	Let's see; can you imitate your father?"
This Chauntecleer his wynges gan to bete,	This Chauntecleer began to beat his wings,
As man that koude his traysoun nat espie,	As one that could not espy his treason,
So was he ravysshed with his flaterie.	He was so ravished with his flattery.
Allas, ye lordes, many a fals flatour	Alas, you lords, many a false flatterer
Is in youre courtes, and many a losengeour,	Is in your courts, and many a sycophant,
That plesen yow wel moore, by my feith,	Who please you well more, by my faith,
Than he that soothfastnesse unto yow seith.	Than he who says the truth unto you.
Redeth Ecclesiaste of flaterye;	Read Ecclesiastes about flattery;
Beth war, ye lordes, of hir trecherye.	Beware, you lords, of their treachery.
This Chauntecleer stood hye upon his toos,	This Chauntecleer stood high upon his toes,

And gan to crowe loude for the nones.	And began to crow loud for the occasion.
And daun Russell the fox stirte up atones,	And dan Russell the fox leaped up at once,
And by the gargat hente Chauntecleer,	And grabbed Chauntecleer by the throat,
And on his bak toward the wode hym beer,	And carried him on his back toward the woods,
For yet ne was ther no man that hym sewed.	For yet there was no one that pursued him.
O destinee, that mayst nat been eschewed!	O destiny, that may not be escaped!
Allas, that Chauntecleer fleigh fro the bemes!	Alas, that Chauntecleer flew from the beams!
Allas, his wyf ne roghte nat of dremes!	Alas, his wife took no heed of dreams!
And on a Friday fil al this meschaunce.	And on a Friday befell all this misfortune.
O Venus, that art goddesse of plesaunce,	O Venus, who art goddess of pleasure,
Syn that thy servant was this Chauntecleer,	Since this Chauntecleer was thy servant,
And in thy servyce dide al his poweer,	And in thy service did all his power,
Moore for delit than world to multiplye,	More for delight than to people the world,
Why woldestow suffre hym on thy day to dye?	Why wouldest thou allow him to die on thy day?
O Gaufred, deere maister soverayn,	O Gaufred, dear supreme master,
That whan thy worthy kyng Richard was slayn	Who when thy worthy king Richard was slain
With shot, compleynedest his deeth so soore,	By shot of an arrow, complained his death so grievously,
Why ne hadde I now thy sentence and thy loore,	Why had I not now thy wisdom and thy learning,
The Friday for to chide, as diden ye?	To chide the Friday, as you did?
For on a Friday, soothly, slayn was he.	For on a Friday, truly, he was slain.
Thanne wolde I shewe yow how that I koude pleyne	Then would I show you how that I could complain
For Chauntecleres drede and for his peyne.	For Chanticleer's dread and for his pain.

Was nevere of ladyes maad whan Ylion	Was never made by ladies when Ilion (Troy)
Was wonne, and Pirrus with his streite swerd,	Was won, and Pirrus with his drawn sword,
Whan he hadde hent kyng Priam by the berd,	When he had seized king Priam by the beard,
And slayn hym, as seith us Eneydos,	And slain him, as the Aeneid tells us,
As maden alle the hennes in the clos,	As all the hens made in the yard,
Whan they had seyn of Chauntecleer the sighte.	When they had seen the sight of Chauntecleer.
But sovereynly dame Pertelote shrighte	But supremely dame Pertelote shrieked

Whan that hir housbonde hadde lost his lyf	When her husband had lost his life
And that the Romayns hadde brend Cartage.	And the Romans had burned Carthage.
She was so ful of torment and of rage	She was so full of torment and of rage
That wilfully into the fyr she sterte	That willfully into the fire she leaped
And brende hirselven with a stedefast herte.	And burned herself with a steadfast heart.
O woful hennes, right so criden ye	O woeful hens, exactly so you cried

Of Rome cryden senatoures wyves	Of Rome senators' wives cried
For that hir husbondes losten alle hir lyves --	Because their husbands lost all their lives --
Withouten gilt this Nero hath hem slayn.	Without guilt this Nero has them slain.

And bar upon his bak the cok away,	And carried the cock away upon his back,
And cryden, "Out! Harrow and weylaway!	And cried, "Help! Help and alas!
Ha, ha! The fox!" and after hym they ran,	Ha, ha! The fox!" and after him they ran,
And eek with staves many another man.	And also with staves many another man.

And Malkyn, with a dystaf in hir hand;	And Malkyn, with a distaff in her hand;
Ran cow and calf, and eek the verray hogges,	Ran cow and calf, and also the very hogs,
So fered for the berkyng of the dogges	So frightened for the barking of the dogs
And shoutyng of the men and wommen eeke	And shouting of the men and women also
They ronne so hem thoughte hir herte breeke.	They ran so hard that they thought their hearts would break.

The dokes cryden as men wolde hem quelle;	The ducks cried as if men would them kill;
The gees for feere flowen over the trees;	The geese for fear flew over the trees;
Out of the hyve cam the swarm of bees.	Out of the hive came the swarm of bees.
So hydous was the noyse -- a, benedicitee! --	So hideous was the noise -- a, bless me! --
Certes, he Jakke Straw and his meynee	Certainly, he Jack Straw and his company
Ne made nevere shoutes half so shrille	Never made shouts half so shrill
Whan that they wolden any Flemyng kille,	When they would any Fleming kill,
As thilke day was maad upon the fox.	As that same day was made upon the fox.
Of bras they broghten bemes, and of box,	They brought trumpets of brass, and of box-wood,
Of horn, of boon, in whiche they blewe and powped,	Of horn, of bone, in which they blew and puffed,
And therwithal they skriked and they howped.	And with that they shrieked and they whooped.
It semed as that hevene sholde falle.	It seemed as if heaven should fall.
Now, goode men, I prey yow herkneth alle:	Now, good men, I pray you all to listen:
Lo, how Fortune turneth sodeynly	Lo, how Fortune turns suddenly
The hope and pryde eek of hir enemy!	The hope and pride also of her enemy!
This cok, that lay upon the foxes bak,	This cock, that lay upon the fox's back,
In al his drede unto the fox he spak,	In all his dread unto the fox he spoke,
And seyde, "Sire, if that I were as ye,	And said, "Sir, if I were you,
Yet sholde I seyn, as wys God helpe me,	Yet should I say, as God may help me,
`Turneth agayn, ye proude cherles alle!	`Turn again, all you proud churls!
A verray pestilence upon yow falle!	May a true pestilence fall upon you!
Now I am come unto the wodes syde;	Now I am come unto the wood's side;
Maugree youre heed, the cok shal heere abyde.	Despite all you could do, the cock shall here remain.
I wol hym ete, in feith, and that anon!'"	I will eat him, in faith, and that right away!'"
The fox answerde, "In feith, it shal be don."	The fox answered, "In faith, it shall be done."
And as he spak that word, al sodeynly	And as he spoke that word, all suddenly
This cok brak from his mouth delyverly,	This cock nimbly broke from his mouth,
And heighe upon a tree he fleigh anon.	And high upon a tree he quickly flew.
And whan the fox saugh that the cok was gon,	And when the fox saw that the cock was gone,
"Allas!" quod he, "O Chauntecleer, allas!	"Alas!" said he, "O Chauntecleer, alas!
I have to yow," quod he, "ydoon trespas,	I have to you," said he, "done offense,
In as muche as I maked yow aferd	In as much as I made you afraid
Whan I yow hente and broghte out of the yerd.	When I seized you and brought you out of the yard.
But, sire, I dide it in no wikke entente.	But, sir, I did it with no wicked intention.
Com doun, and I shal telle yow what I mente;	Come down, and I shall tell you what I meant;
I shal seye sooth to yow, God help me so!"	I shall say the truth to you, as God may help me!"
"Nay thanne," quod he, "I shrewe us bothe two.	"Nay then," said he, "I curse both of us two.
And first I shrewe myself, bothe blood and bones,	And first I curse myself, both blood and bones,
If thou bigyle me ofter than ones.	If thou trick me more often than once.
Thou shalt namoore thurgh thy flaterye	Thou shalt no more through thy flattery
Do me to synge and wynke with myn ye;	Make me sing and close my eyes;
For he that wynketh, whan he sholde see,	For he that closes his eyes, when he should see,
Al wilfully, God lat him nevere thee!"	All willfully, God let him never prosper!"
"Nay," quod the fox, "but God yeve hym meschaunce,	"Nay," said the fox, "but God give him misfortune,
That is so undiscreet of governaunce	Who is so indiscreet of governance
That jangleth whan he sholde holde his pees."	That he chatters when he should hold his peace."
Lo, swich it is for to be recchelees	Lo, such it is to be careless
And necligent, and truste on flaterye.	And negligent, and trust on flattery.
But ye that holden this tale a folye,	But you who hold this tale a folly,

Taketh the moralite, goode men.	Take the morality, good men.

To oure doctrine it is ywrite, ywis;	Is written for our instruction, indeed;

Now, goode God, if that it be thy wille,	Now, good God, if it be thy will,
As seith my lord, so make us alle goode men,	As says my lord, make us all good men,
And brynge us to his heighe blisse! Amen.	And bring us to his high bliss! Amen.
"Sire Nonnes Preest," oure Hooste seide anoon,	"Sir Nun's Priest," our Host said straightway,
"I-blessed be thy breche, and every stoon!	"Blessed be thy buttocks, and every testicle!
This was a murie tale of Chauntecleer.	This was a merry tale of Chanticleer.
But by my trouthe, if thou were seculer,	But by my troth, if thou were a layman,
Thou woldest ben a trede-foul aright.	Thou would be an excellent copulator of fouls (rooster).
For if thou have corage as thou hast myght,	For if thou have as much desire as thou hast might,
Thee were nede of hennes, as I wene,	Thou would have need of hens, as I think,
Ya, moo than seven tymes seventene.	Yea, more than seven times seventeen.
See, whiche braunes hath this gentil preest,	See, what muscles has this gentle priest,
So gret a nekke, and swich a large breest!	So big a neck, and such a large chest!
He loketh as a sperhauk with his yen;	He looks like a sparrow-hauk with his eyes;
Him nedeth nat his colour for to dyen	He needs not paint his complexion
With brasile ne with greyn of Portyngale.	With red dye nor with grain of Portugal.
Now, sire, faire falle yow for youre tale!"	Now, sir, may good fortune come to you for your tale!"
And after that he, with ful merie chere,	And after that he, with a very merry manner,
Seide unto another, as ye shuln heere.	Said unto another, as you shall hear.
The Prologe of the Freres Tale.	The Prologue of the Friar's Tale.
This worthy lymytour, this noble Frere,	This worthy licensed beggar, this noble Friar
He made alwey a maner louryng chiere	He always made a kind of scowling face
Upon the Somonour, but for honestee	At the Summoner, but for propriety
No vileyns word as yet to hym spak he.	No churlish word as yet to him spoke he.
But atte laste he seyde unto the wyf,	"Dame," quod he, "God yeve yow right good lyf!
"My lady," said he, "God give you a right good life!	"My lady," said he, "God give you a right good life!
Ye han heer touched, also moot I thee,	You have here touched, as I may prosper,
In scole-matere greet difficultee.	On academic problems of great difficulty.
Ye han seyd muche thyng right wel, I seye;	You have said many things right well, I say;
But, dame, heere as we ryde by the weye,	But, my lady, here as we ride by the way,
Us nedeth nat to speken but of game,	We need not speak of anything but pleasant matters,
And lete auctoritees, on Goddes name,	And leave authoritative texts, in God's name,
To prechyng and to scoles of clergye.	To preaching and to the universities.
But if it lyke to this compaignye,	But if it pleases this company,
I wol yow of a somonour telle a game.	I will tell you an amusing tale about a summoner.
Pardee, ye may wel knowe by the name	By God, you can easily tell by the name
That of a somonour may no good be sayd;	That no good may be said of a summoner;
I praye that noon of you be yvele apayd.	I pray that none of you be displeased.
A somonour is a rennere up and doun	A summoner is a runner up and down
With mandementz for fornicacioun,	With summonses for fornication,
And is ybet at every townes ende."	And is beaten (and driven away) at every town's end."
Oure Hoost tho spak, "A, sire, ye sholde be hende	Our Host then spoke, "Ah, sir, you should be polite
And curteys, as a man of youre estaat;	And courteous, as (befits) a man of your rank;
In compaignye we wol have no debaat.	In this company we will have no arguments.
Telleth youre tale, and lat the Somonour be."	Tell your tale, and leave the Summoner alone."
"Nay," quod the Somonour, "lat hym seye to me	"Nay," said the Summoner, "let him say to me
What so hym list; whan it comth to my lot,	Whatever he pleases; when it comes to my turn,
By God, I shal hym quiten every grot.	By God, I shall pay him back every groat (fourpence).
I shal hym tellen which a greet honour	I shall tell him what a great honor
It is to be a flaterynge lymytour,	It is to be a flattering licensed beggar,
And of many another manere cryme	And of many another sort of crime
Which nedeth nat rehercen at this tyme;	Which need not be told at this time;
And his office I shal hym telle, ywis."	And how he does his job I shall tell him, indeed."
Oure Hoost answerde, "Pees, namoore of this!"	Our Host answered, "Quiet, no more of this!"
And after this he seyde unto the Frere,	And after this he said unto the Friar,
"Tel forth youre tale, leeve maister deere."	"Tell forth your tale, beloved master dear."
Heere bigynneth the Freres Tale	Here begins the Friar's Tale
Whilom ther was dwellynge in my contree	Once there was dwelling in my country
An erchedeken, a man of heigh degree,	An archdeacon, a man of high rank,
That boldely dide execucioun	That boldly carried out the law
In punysshynge of fornicacioun,	In punishment of fornication,
Of wicchecraft, and eek of bawderye,	Of witchcraft, and also of pandering,
Of diffamacioun, and avowtrye,	Of defamation of character, and adultery,
Of chirche reves, and of testamentz,	Of robbing churches, and of wills,
Of contractes and of lakke of sacramentz,	Of marriage contracts and of failure to take the sacraments,
Of usure, and of symonye also.	Of usury, and of simony also.
But certes, lecchours dide he grettest wo;	But certainly, to lechers did he the greatest woe;
They sholde syngen if that they were hent;	They had to sing out in pain if they were taken;
And smale tytheres weren foule yshent,	And those who paid less than full tithes were severely punished,
If any persoun wolde upon hem pleyne.	If any parson would complain about them.
Ther myghte asterte hym no pecunyal peyne.	There could escape him no monetary punishment (fine).
For smale tithes and for smal offrynge	For small tithes and for small offering
He made the peple pitously to synge,	He made the people piteously to sing out in pain,
For er the bisshop caughte hem with his hook,	For ere the bishop caught them with his crozier,
They weren in the erchedeknes book.	They were in the archdeacon's book.
Thanne hadde he, thurgh his jurisdiccioun,	Then had he, throughout his jurisdiction,
Power to doon on hem correccioun.	Power to have them punished.
He hadde a somonour redy to his hond;	He had a summoner ready at his hand;
A slyer boye nas noon in Engelond;	No one in England was a more clever rascal;
For subtilly he hadde his espiaille,	For deviously he had his network of spies,
That taughte hym wel wher that hym myghte availle.	That showed him well where there might be profit for him.
He koude spare of lecchours oon or two,	He could spare one or two of the lechers,
To techen hym to foure and twenty mo.	To direct him to four and twenty more.
For thogh this Somonour wood were as an hare,	For though this Summoner were mad as a hare,
To telle his harlotrye I wol nat spare;	To tell his wickedness I will not desist;
For we are out of his correccioun.	For we are exempt from his authority.
They han of us no jurisdiccioun,	They have over us no jurisdiction,
Ne nevere shullen, terme of alle hir lyves.	Nor never shall, until the end of all their lives.
"Peter! so been wommen of the styves,"	"By St. Peter! so are women of the brothels,"
Quod the Somonour, "yput out of oure cure!"	Said the Summoner, "put out of our jurisdiction!"
"Pees! with myschance and with mysaventure!"	"Quiet! with bad luck and with misfortune to you!"
Thus seyde oure Hoost, "and lat hym telle his tale.	Thus said our Host, "and let him tell his tale.
Now telleth forth, thogh that the Somonour gale;	Now tell forth, though the Summoner loudly complain;
Ne spareth nat, myn owene maister deere."	And tell everything, my own master dear."
This false theef, this somonour, quod the Frere,	This false thief, this summoner, said the Friar,
Hadde alwey bawdes redy to his hond,	Had always pimps as ready to his hand,
As any hauk to lure in Engelond,	As any hawk to come to the lure in England,
That tolde hym al the secree that they knewe,	Who told him all the secrets that they knew,
For hire acqueyntance was nat come of newe.	For their acquaintance was not come recently.
They weren his approwours prively.	They were secretly his agents.
He took hymself a greet profit therby;	He got himself a great profit in this way;
His maister knew nat alwey what he wan.	His master knew not always what he earned.
Withouten mandement a lewed man	Without an actual summons an ignorant man
He koude somne, on peyne of Cristes curs,	He could summon, on pain of excommunication,
And they were glade for to fille his purs	And they were glad to fill his purse

Til atte laste she spak in this manere	Until at the last she spoke in this manner
Unto the hauk, as ye shal after heere:	Unto the hawk, as you shall after hear:
"What is the cause, if it be for to telle,	"What is the cause, if it may be told,
That ye be in this furial pyne of helle?"	That you be in this pain such as the Furies suffer in hell?"
Quod Canacee unto this hauk above.	Said Canacee unto this hawk above.
"Is this for sorwe of deeth or los of love?	"Is this for sorrow of death or loss of love?
For, as I trowe, thise been causes two	For, as I believe, these are the two causes
That causen moost a gentil herte wo;	That most cause woe to a gentle heart;
Of oother harm it nedeth nat to speke.	Of other harm there is no need to speak.
For ye youreself upon yourself yow wreke,	For you avenge yourself upon yourself,
Which proveth wel that outher ire or drede	Which proves well that either anger or fear
Moot been enchesoun of youre cruel dede,	Must be the reason for your cruel deed,
Syn that I see noon oother wight yow chace.	Since I see no other creature hunt you.
For love of God, as dooth youreselven grace,	For love of God, spare yourself,
Or what may been youre help? For west nor est	Or what can be your help? For west nor east
Ne saugh I nevere er now no bryd ne beest	I saw never ere now no bird nor beast
That ferde with hymself so pitously.	That treated himself so piteously.
Ye sle me with youre sorwe verraily,	You slay me with your sorrow truly,
I have of yow so greet compassioun.	I have of you such great compassion.
For Goddes love, com fro the tree adoun;	For God's love, come down from the tree;
And as I am a kynges doghter trewe,	And as I am a king's daughter true,
If that I verraily the cause knewe	If that I truly knew the cause
Of youre disese, if it lay in my myght,	Of your malady, if it lay in my power,
I wolde amenden it er that it were nyght,	I would amend it ere it were night,
As wisly helpe me grete God of kynde!	So help me great God of nature!
And herbes shal I right ynowe yfynde	And herbs shall I in abundance find
To heel with youre hurtes hastily."	With which to heal your hurts quickly."
Tho shrighte this faucon yet moore pitously	Then shrieked this falcon yet more pitifully
Than ever she dide, and fil to grounde anon,	Than ever she did, and fell to ground straightway,
And lith aswowne, deed and lyk a stoon,	And lies in a swoon, dead and like a stone,
Til Canacee hath in hire lappe hire take	Until Canacee has in her lap her taken
Unto the tyme she gan of swough awake.	Until the time she awoke from the swoon.
And after that she of hir swough gan breyde,	And after she started up from her swoon,
Right in hir haukes ledene thus she seyde:	Right in her hawk's language thus she said:
"That pitee renneth soone in gentil herte,	"That pity runs soon in a gentle heart,
Feelynge his similitude in peynes smerte,	Feeling its counterpart in sharp pains,
Is preved alday, as men may it see,	Is proven every day, as men may it see,
As wel by werk as by auctoritee;	As well by deeds as by written authority;
For gentil herte kitheth gentillesse.	For a gentle heart makes known its noble character.
I se wel that ye han of my distresse	I see well that you have of my distress
Compassion, my faire Canacee,	Compassion, my faire Canacee,
Of verray wommanly benignytee	Out of true womanly goodness
That Nature in youre principles hath set.	That Nature in your natural disposition has set.
But for noon hope for to fare the bet,	But for no hope to fare the better,
But for to obeye unto youre herte free,	But to obey unto your heart noble,
And for to maken othere be war by me,	And to make others be warned by my example,
As by the whelp chasted is the leon,	As by the whelp chastised is the lion,
Right for that cause and that conclusion,	Right for that cause and to that conclusion,
Whil that I have a leyser and a space,	While that I have the time and the opportunity,
Myn harm I wol confessen er I pace."	My harm I will reveal ere I go away."
And evere, whil that oon hir sorwe tolde,	And ever, while that one her sorrow told,
That oother weep as she to water wolde	That other wept as she would turn to water
Til that the faucon bad hire to be stille,	Until the falcon prayed her to be still,
And, with a syk, right thus she seyde hir wille:	And, with a sigh, right thus she spoke her mind:
"Ther I was bred -- allas, that ilke day! --	"Where I was bred -- alas, that same day! --
And fostred in a roche of marbul gray	And fostered on a cliff of marble gray
So tendrely that no thyng eyled me,	So tenderly that no thing ailed me,
I nyste nat what was adversitee	I knew not what was adversity
Til I koude flee ful hye under the sky.	Until I could fly full high under the sky.
Tho dwelte a tercelet me faste by,	Then dwelt a male falcon very near me,
That semed welle of alle gentillesse;	That seemed an exemplar of all nobility;
Al were he ful of treson and falsnesse,	Although he was full of treason and falseness,
It was so wrapped under humble cheere,	It was so concealed under humble bearing,
And under hewe of trouthe in swich manere,	And under the appearance of truth in such a manner,
Under plesance, and under bisy peyne,	Under pleasantness, and under careful attentiveness,
That no wight koude han wend he koude feyne,	That no creature could have supposed he could feign,
So depe in greyn he dyed his coloures.	So deeply in a fast dye he dyed his true colors.
Right as a serpent hit hym under floures	Just as a serpent hides himself under flowers
Til he may seen his tyme for to byte,	Until he can see his time to bite,
Right so this god of loves ypocryte	Just so this god of love's hypocrite
Dooth so his cerymonyes and obeisaunces,	So does his ceremonies and obeisances,
And kepeth in semblaunt alle his observaunces	And keeps in outward appearance all his observances
That sownen into gentillesse of love.	That are in accord with nobility in love.
As in a toumbe is al the faire above,	As in a tomb all the beauty is above,
And under is the corps, swich as ye woot,	And under is the corpse, as you know,
Swich was this ypocrite, bothe coold and hoot.	Such was this hypocrite, in every circumstance.
And in this wise he served his entente	And in this manner he served his own purpose
That, save the feend, noon wiste what he mente,	So that, except for the fiend, no one knew what he meant,
Til he so longe hadde wopen and compleyned,	Until he so long had wept and complained,
And many a yeer his service to me feyned,	And many a year his service to me feigned,
Til that myn herte, to pitous and to nyce,	Until my heart, too compassionate and too naive,
Al innocent of his crouned malice,	Entirely ignorant of his consummate malice,
Forfered of his deeth, as thoughte me,	Very frightened that he might die, as it seemed to me,
Upon his othes and his seuretee,	Upon receiving his oaths and his pledges,
Graunted hym love, upon this condicioun,	Granted him love, upon this condition,
That everemoore myn honour and renoun	That evermore my honor and renown
Were saved, bothe privee and apert;	Were safe, both in private and in public (in all ways);
This is to seyn, that after his desert,	This is to say, that according to his deserts,
I yaf hym al myn herte and al my thoght --	I gave him all my heart and all my thought --
God woot and he, that ootherwise noght --	God knows and he, I would not have agreed on any other terms --
And took his herte in chaunge of myn for ay.	And took his heart in exchange for mine for ever.
But sooth is seyd, goon sithen many a day,	But truly it is said, since many a day gone by,
`A trewe wight and a theef thenken nat oon.'	`An honest creature and a thief think not alike.'
And whan he saugh the thyng so fer ygoon	And when he saw the business so far advanced
That I hadde graunted hym fully my love	That I had granted him fully my love
In swich a gyse as I have seyd above,	In such a manner as I have said above,
And yeven hym my trewe herte as free	And gave him my true heart as freely
As he swoor he yaf his herte to me,	As he swore he gave his heart to me,
Anon this tigre, ful of doublenesse,	Immediately this tiger, full of treachery,
Fil on his knees with so devout humblesse,	Fell on his knees with such devout humility,
With so heigh reverence, and, as by his cheere,	With such high reverence, and, as seemed by his appearance,
So lyk a gentil lovere of manere,	So like a gentle lover in his manners,
So ravysshed, as it semed, for the joye	So ravished, as it seemed, for the joy
That nevere Jason ne Parys of Troye --	That never Jason nor Paris of Troy --
Jason? certes, ne noon oother man	Jason? certainly, nor any other man
Syn Lameth was, that alderfirst bigan	Since Lameth was, he who first of all began
To loven two, as writen folk biforn --	To love two, as folk wrote long ago --
Ne nevere, syn the firste man was born,	Nor ever, since the first man was born,
Ne koude man, by twenty thousand part,	Could (any) man, by (so much as) one twenty thousandth,
Countrefete the sophymes of his art,	Reproduce the deceptive sophisms of his art,
Ne were worthy unbokelen his galoche,	Nor were worthy to unbuckle his galosh,
Ther doublenesse or feynyng sholde approche,	Where duplicity or feigning were concerned,
Ne so koude thonke a wight as he dide me!	Nor so could thank a creature as he did to me!
His manere was an hevene for to see	His manner was a heaven to see
Til any womman, were she never so wys,	For any woman, were she never so wise,
So peynted he and kembde at point-devys	So painted he and made himself elegant in every way,
As wel his wordes as his contenaunce.	Both his words and his countenance.
And I so loved hym for his obeisaunce,	And I so loved him for his obeisance,
And for the trouthe I demed in his herte,	And for the truth I believed was in his heart,
That if so were that any thyng hym smerte,	That if it so were that any thing pained him,
Al were it never so lite, and I it wiste,	Although it were never so little, and I knew of it,
Me thoughte I felte deeth myn herte twiste.	It seemed to me I felt death twist my heart.
And shortly, so ferforth this thyng is went	And shortly, this business had gone forth so far
That my wyl was his willes instrument;	That my will was his will's instrument;
This is to seyn, my wyl obeyed his wyl	This is to say, my will obeyed his will
In alle thyng, as fer as reson fil,	In all things, so far as was consonant with reason,
Kepynge the boundes of my worshipe evere.	Keeping ever the limits set by my honor.
Ne nevere hadde I thyng so lief, ne levere,	Nor never loved anyone more, or even as much
As hym, God woot, ne nevere shal namo.	As him, God knows, nor never shall again.
"This laste lenger than a yeer or two,	"This lasted longer than a year or two,
That I supposed of hym noght but good.	That I supposed of him nothing but good.
But finally, thus atte laste it stood,	But finally, thus at the last it stood,
That Fortune wolde that he moste twynne	That Fortune would have it that he must depart
Out of that place which that I was inne.	Out of that place where I was.
Wher me was wo, that is no questioun;	Whether I was woeful, there is no question;
I kan nat make of it discripsioun.	I can not make a description of it.
For o thyng dar I tellen boldely:	For one thing I dare tell boldly:
I knowe what is the peyne of deeth therby;	By this experience I know what is the pain of death;
Swich harm I felte for he ne myghte bileve.	Such harm I felt because he could not remain.
So on a day of me he took his leve,	So one day he took his leave of me,
So sorwefully eek that I wende verraily	So sorrowfully also that I believed truly
That he had felt as muche harm as I,	That he had felt as much harm as I,
Whan that I herde hym speke and saugh his hewe.	When I heard him speak and saw his appearance.
But nathelees, I thoughte he was so trewe,	But nevertheless, I thought he was so true,
And eek that he repaire sholde ageyn	And also that he should return again
Withinne a litel while, sooth to seyn;	Within a little while, to say the truth;
And resoun wolde eek that he moste go	And it was reasonable also that he must go
For his honour, as ofte it happeth so,	For his honor, as often it happens so,
That I made vertu of necessitee,	So that I made virtue of necessity,
And took it wel, syn that it moste be.	And took it well, since it had to be.
As I best myghte, I hidde fro hym my sorwe,	As I best could, I hid from him my sorrow,
And took hym by the hond, Seint John to borwe,	And took him by the hand, with Saint John as my guarantor,
And seyde hym thus: `Lo, I am youres al;	And said to him thus: `Lo, I am all yours;
Beth swich as I to yow have been and shal.'	Be to me such as I to you have been and shall be.'
What he answerde, it nedeth noght reherce;	What he answered, it needs not be repeated;
Who kan sey bet than he, who kan do werse?	Who can speak better than he, who can act worse?
Whan he hath al wel seyd, thanne hath he doon.	When he has said everything well, then he has done (all he will do).
`Therfore bihoveth hire a ful long spoon	`Therefore she must have a very long spoon
That shal ete with a feend,' thus herde I seye.	Who shall eat with a fiend,' thus I have heard said.
So atte laste he moste forth his weye,	So at the last he had to go forth on his way,
And forth he fleeth til he cam ther hym leste.	And forth he speeds until he came where he pleased.
Whan it cam hym to purpos for to reste,	When he decided to rest,
I trowe he hadde thilke text in mynde,	I believe he had that text in mind,
That `alle thyng, repeirynge to his kynde,	That `every thing, by returning to its natural state,
Gladeth hymself;' thus seyn men, as I gesse.	Makes himself happy;' thus say men, as I suppose.
Men loven of propre kynde newefangelnesse,	Men, because of their nature, love novelty,
As briddes doon that men in cages fede.	As do birds that men feed in cages.
For though thou nyght and day take of hem hede,	For though thou take care of them night and day,
And strawe hir cage faire and softe as silk,	And strew their cages with straw fair and soft as silk,
And yeve hem sugre, hony, breed and milk,	And give them sugar, honey, bread and milk,
Yet right anon as that his dore is uppe	Yet just as soon as his door is left open
He with his feet wol spurne adoun his cuppe,	He with his feet will kick down his cup,
And to the wode he wole and wormes ete;	And to the wood he will go and eat worms;
So newefangel been they of hire mete,	They are so fond of novelty in their food,
And loven novelries of propre kynde,	And love novelties because of their nature,
No gentillesse of blood ne may hem bynde.	No nobility of blood can restrain them.
"So ferde this tercelet, allas the day!	"So fared this falcon, alas the day!
Though he were gentil born, and fressh and gay,	Though he was of noble birth, and fresh and gay,
And goodlich for to seen, and humble and free,	And goodly to look upon and humble and generous,
He saugh upon a tyme a kyte flee,	He saw upon a time a kite (scavenger bird) fly by,
And sodeynly he loved this kyte so	And suddenly he so loved this kite
That al his love is clene fro me ago,	That all his love is completely gone from me,
And hath his trouthe falsed in this wyse.	And has turned his truth false in this manner.
Thus hath the kyte my love in hire servyse,	Thus has the kite my lover in her service,
And I am lorn withouten remedie!"	And I am lost, without remedy!"
And with that word this faucon gan to crie	And with that word this falcon did cry out
And swowned eft in Canacees barm.	And swooned again in Canacee's lap.
Greet was the sorwe for the haukes harm	Great was the sorrow for the hawk's harm
That Canacee and alle hir wommen made;	That Canacee and all her women made;
They nyste hou they myghte the faucon glade.	They knew not how they might cheer up the falcon.
But Canacee hom bereth hire in hir lappe,	But Canacee carries her home enfolded in her gown,
And softely in plastres gan hire wrappe,	And softly did wrap her in bandages,
Ther as she with hire beek hadde hurt hirselve.	Where she with her beak had hurt herself.
Now kan nat Canacee but herbes delve	Now Canacee can do nothing but dig herbs
Out of the ground, and make salves newe	Out of the ground, and make new salves
Of herbes preciouse and fyne of hewe	Of herbs, precious and delicate in color,
To heelen with this hauk. Fro day to nyght	With which to heal this hawk. From dawn to nighttime
She dooth hire bisynesse and al hire myght,	She devotes her efforts and all her power,
And by hire beddes heed she made a mewe	And by her bed's head she made a pen
And covered it with veluettes blewe,	And covered it with velvet cloths, blue
In signe of trouthe that is in wommen sene.	As a sign of truth that is in women seen.
And al withoute, the mewe is peynted grene,	And on all the outside, the pen is painted green,
In which were peynted alle thise false fowles,	In which were painted all these false fowls,
As ben thise tidyves, tercelettes, and owles;	Such as are these small birds, falcons, and owls;
Right for despit were peynted hem bisyde,	For sheer scorn were painted beside them,
Pyes, on hem for to crie and chyde.	Magpies, to cry out against them and chide them.
Thus lete I Canacee hir hauk kepyng;	Thus I leave Canacee keeping her hawk;
I wol namoore as now speke of hir ryng	I will for now speak no more of her ring
Til it come eft to purpos for to seyn	Until it becomes again appropriate to tell
How that this faucon gat hire love ageyn	How this falcon got back her love,
Repentant, as the storie telleth us,	Repentant, as the story tells us,
By mediacion of Cambalus,	By the mediation of Cambalus,
The kynges sone, of which I yow tolde.	The king's son, of whom I told you.

Whilom, as olde stories tellen us,	Once, as old histories tell us,
Ther was a duc that highte Theseus;	There was a duke who was called Theseus;
Of Atthenes he was lord and governour,	He was lord and governor of Athens,
And in his tyme swich a conquerour	And in his time such a conqueror
That gretter was ther noon under the sonne.	That there was no one greater under the sun.
Ful many a riche contree hadde he wonne;	Very many a powerful country had he won;
What with his wysdom and his chivalrie,	What with his wisdom and his chivalry,

And of the feste that was at hir weddynge,	And of the festivity that was at their wedding,
And of the tempest at hir hoom-comynge;	And of the storm at her home-coming;
But al that thyng I moot as now forbere.	But all that matter I must now forgo.

And wayke been the oxen in my plough.	And the oxen in my plow are weak.
The remenant of the tale is long ynough.	The remnant of the tale is long enough.

Lat every felawe telle his tale aboute,	Let every fellow tell his tale in turn,
And lat se now who shal the soper wynne;	And let's see now who shall win the supper;
And ther I lefte, I wol ayeyn bigynne.	And where I left off, I will again begin.

Or who hath yow mysboden or offended?	Or who has injured or offended you?
And telleth me if it may been amended,	And tell me if it may be remedied,
And why that ye been clothed thus in blak."	And why you are clothed thus in black."

Whan she hadde swowned with a deedly cheere,	After she had swooned with (so) deadly a countenance,
That it was routhe for to seen and heere;	That it was pitiful to see and hear;

And yet now the olde Creon -- weylaway! --	And yet now the old Creon -- woe oh woe! --

Neither to been yburyed nor ybrent,	Neither to be buried nor burned,
But maketh houndes ete them in despit."	But makes hounds eat them as an insult."
And with that word, withouten moore respit,	And with that word, without more delay,
They fillen gruf and criden pitously,	They fell face down and cried piteously,
"Have on us wrecched wommen som mercy,	"Have some mercy on us wretched women,
And lat oure sorwe synken in thyn herte."	And let our sorrow sink in thy heart."
This gentil duc doun from his courser sterte	This gentle duke leaped down from his war horse
With herte pitous, whan he herde them speke.	With compassionate heart, when he heard them speak.
Hym thoughte that his herte wolde breke,	It seemed to him that his heart would break,
Whan he saugh hem so pitous and so maat,	When he saw them so pitiful and so dejected,

How Creon was of Theseus yserved	How Creon was treated by Theseus
As he that hadde his deeth ful wel deserved.	As one who had very well deserved his death.

To Thebes-ward, and al his hoost biside.	Toward Thebes, and all his army beside (him).
No neer Atthenes wolde he go ne ride,	He would not walk nor ride any nearer to Athens,
Ne take his ese fully half a day,	Nor take his ease fully half a day,
But onward on his wey that nyght he lay,	But that night he lay (camped) on his way,
And sente anon Ypolita the queene,	And sent straightway Ypolita the queen,
And Emelye, hir yonge suster sheene,	And Emelye, her beautiful young sister,
Unto the toun of Atthenes to dwelle,	Unto the town of Athens to dwell,
And forth he rit; ther is namoore to telle.	And forth he rides; there is no more to tell.

Of gold ful riche, in which ther was ybete	Of very rich gold, in which there was embroidered
The Mynotaur, which that he wan in Crete.	The Minotaur, which he defeated in Crete.

Til that he cam to Thebes and alighte	Until he came to Thebes and dismounted
Faire in a feeld, ther as he thoughte to fighte.	Graciously in a field, where he intended to fight.

With Creon, which that was of Thebes kyng,	With Creon, who was king of Thebes,
He faught, and slough hym manly as a knyght	He fought, and slew him boldly as a knight
In pleyn bataille, and putte the folk to flyght;	In open battle, and put the army to flight;
And by assaut he wan the citee after,	And by assault he won the city afterwards,
And rente adoun bothe wall and sparre and rafter;	And tore down both wall and beam and rafter;
And to the ladyes he restored agayn	And he gave back to the ladies
The bones of hir freendes that were slayn,	The bones of their husbands who were slain,
To doon obsequies, as was tho the gyse.	To do obsequies, as was then the custom.
But it were al to longe for to devyse	But it would be all too long to describe
The grete clamour and the waymentynge	The great clamor and the lamentation
That the ladyes made at the brennynge	That the ladies made at the burning
Of the bodies, and the grete honour	Of the bodies, and the great honor

And so bifel that in the taas they founde,	And (it) so befell that in the heap they found,

But by hir cote-armures and by hir gere	But by their coats of arms and by their equipment
The heraudes knewe hem best in special	The heralds best knew them in particular
As they that weren of the blood roial	As they that were of the royal blood
Of Thebes, and of sustren two yborn.	Of Thebes, and born of two sisters.
Out of the taas the pilours han hem torn,	The scavengers have pulled them out of the heap,
And han hem caried softe unto the tente	And have carried them softy unto the tent

To Atthenes, to dwellen in prisoun	To Athens, to dwell in prison
Perpetuelly -- he nolde no raunsoun.	Perpetually -- he would not (accept) any ransom.

With laurer crowned as a conquerour;	As a conqueror crowned with laurel;
And ther he lyveth in joye and in honour	And there he lives in joy and in honor
Terme of his lyf; what nedeth wordes mo?	For the duration of his life; what more words are needed?

For everemoore; ther may no gold hem quite.	For evermore (remain); no gold can ransom them.

This Arcite ful proudly spak ageyn:	This Arcite full proudly spoke in return:
"Thow shalt," quod he, "be rather fals than I;	"Thou shalt," said he, "be rather false than I;
And thou art fals, I telle thee outrely,	And thou art false, I tell thee flatly,
For paramour I loved hire first er thow.	As a mistress I loved her first before thou.
What wiltow seyen? Thou woost nat yet now	What wilt thou say? Thou knowest not yet now
Wheither she be a womman or goddesse!	Whether she is a woman or goddess!
Thyn is affeccioun of hoolynesse,	Thine is a feeling of holiness,
And myn is love as to a creature;	And mine is love as to a creature;
For which I tolde thee myn aventure	For which I told thee my circumstance
As to my cosyn and my brother sworn.	As to my cousin and my sworn brother.
I pose that thow lovedest hire biforn;	I posit (this assumption): that thou lovedest her first;
Wostow nat wel the olde clerkes sawe,	Knowest thou not well the old clerks' saying,
That `who shal yeve a lovere any lawe?'	That `who shall give a lover any law?'
Love is a gretter lawe, by my pan,	Love is a greater law, by my skull,
Than may be yeve to any erthely man;	Than may be given to any earthly man;
And therfore positif lawe and swich decree	And therefore positive (man-made) law and such decree
Is broken al day for love in ech degree.	Is broken every day for love in every way.

He may nat fleen it, thogh he sholde be deed,	He can not flee (from) it, though he should be dead,

Perpetuelly; us gayneth no raunsoun.	Perpetually; no ransom can help us.
We stryve as dide the houndes for the boon;	We strive as the hounds did for the bone;
They foughte al day, and yet hir part was noon.	They fought all day, and yet their share was nothing.
Ther cam a kyte, whil that they were so wrothe,	There came a kite, while they were so angry,
And baar awey the boon bitwixe hem bothe.	And carried away the bone between them both.
And therfore, at the kynges court, my brother,	And therefore, at the king's court, my brother,
Ech man for hymself, ther is noon oother.	Each man for himself, there is no other (way).
Love, if thee list, for I love and ay shal;	Love, if it please thee, for I love and always shall;

Greet was the strif and long bitwix hem tweye,	Great and long was the strife between them two,
If that I hadde leyser for to seye;	If I had leisure to tell (it);

And he loved hym als tendrely agayn.	And he (Theseus) loved him as tenderly in turn.
So wel they lovede, as olde bookes sayn,	So well they loved, as old books say,
That whan that oon was deed, soothly to telle,	That when one was dead, truly to tell,
His felawe wente and soughte hym doun in helle --	His friend went and sought him down in hell --

Ther nas noon oother remedie ne reed;	There was no other remedy nor course of action;
But taketh his leve, and homward he him spedde.	But (he) takes his leave, and homeward he sped.
Lat hym be war! His nekke lith to wedde.	Let him be ware! His neck lies as a pledge.
How greet a sorwe suffreth now Arcite!	How great a sorrow now suffers Arcite!
The deeth he feeleth thurgh his herte smyte;	He feels the death smite through his heart;
He wepeth, wayleth, crieth pitously;	He weeps, wails, cries piteously;
To sleen hymself he waiteth prively.	To slay himself he secretly awaits (an opportunity).
He seyde, "Allas that day that I was born!	He said, "Alas that day that I was born!
Now is my prisoun worse than biforn;	Now my prison is worse than before;
Now is me shape eternally to dwelle	Now I am destined eternally to dwell

Therwith the fyr of jalousie up sterte	With that the fire of jealousy started up
Withinne his brest, and hente him by the herte	Within his breast, and seized him by the heart
So woodly that he lyk was to biholde	So madly that he was to look upon like
The boxtree or the asshen dede and colde.	The box tree or the ash dead and cold.
Thanne seyde he, "O crueel goddes that governe	Then said he, "O cruel gods that govern
This world with byndyng of youre word eterne,	This world with binding of your eternal word,
And writen in the table of atthamaunt	And write in the table of adamant (hardest of stones)
Youre parlement and youre eterne graunt,	Your decision and your eternal decree,
What is mankynde moore unto you holde	Why is mankind more obligated unto you
Than is the sheep that rouketh in the folde?	Than is the sheep that cowers in the sheepfold?
For slayn is man right as another beest,	For man is slain exactly like another beast,
And dwelleth eek in prison and arreest,	And dwells also in prison and detention,
And hath siknesse and greet adversitee,	And has sickness and great adversity,
And ofte tymes giltelees, pardee.	And often times guiltless, indeed.

And yet encresseth this al my penaunce,	And yet this increases all my suffering,
That man is bounden to his observaunce,	That man is bound to his duty,
For Goddes sake, to letten of his wille,	For God's sake, to refrain from his desire,
Ther as a beest may al his lust fulfille.	Whereas a beast may fulfill all his desire.

Though in this world he have care and wo.	Though in this world he may have (had) care and woe.
Withouten doute it may stonden so.	Without doubt such is the case.
The answere of this lete I to dyvynys,	The answer to this I leave to theologians,
But wel I woot that in this world greet pyne ys.	But well I know that great pain is in this world.

For jalousie and fere of hym Arcite."	For jealousy and fear of this Arcite."
Now wol I stynte of Palamon a lite,	Now will I cease (speaking of) of Palamon for a little while,
And lete hym in his prisoun stille dwelle,	And leave him to dwell in his prison still,
And of Arcita forth I wol yow telle.	And of Arcite forth I will tell you.
The somer passeth, and the nyghtes longe	The summer passes, and the long nights
Encressen double wise the peynes stronge	Increase doubly the strong pains
Bothe of the lovere and the prisoner.	Both of the lover and the prisoner.
I noot which hath the wofuller mester.	I know not which has the more woeful task.
For, shortly for to seyn, this Palamoun	For, briefly to say (it), this Palamon
Perpetuelly is dampned to prisoun,	Is damned perpetually to prison,
In cheynes and in fettres to been deed;	In chains and in fetters to be dead;
And Arcite is exiled upon his heed	And Arcite is exiled on threat of losing his head
For everemo, as out of that contree,	For evermore, out of that country,
Ne nevere mo ne shal his lady see.	Nor nevermore shall see his lady.
Yow loveres axe I now this questioun:	Yow lovers now I ask this question:
Who hath the worse, Arcite or Palamoun?	Who has the worse, Arcite or Palamon?
That oon may seen his lady day by day,	That one may see his lady every day,

That oother wher hym list may ride or go,	That other where he pleases may ride or walk,
But seen his lady shal he nevere mo.	But he shall see his lady nevermore.
Now demeth as yow liste, ye that kan,	Now judge as it pleases you, you who know (of such things),
For I wol telle forth as I bigan.	For I will tell forth as I began.
Whan that Arcite to Thebes comen was,	When Arcite was come to Thebes,
Ful ofte a day he swelte and seyde "Allas!"	Very often each day he grew faint and said "Alas!"
For seen his lady shal he nevere mo.	For he shall never more see his lady.
And shortly to concluden al his wo,	And shortly to conclude (telling) all his woe,
So muche sorwe hadde nevere creature	So much sorrow never had creature
That is, or shal, whil that the world may dure.	That is, or shall (be), while the world may endure.
His slep, his mete, his drynke, is hym biraft,	He is bereft of his sleep, his food, his drink
That lene he wex and drye as is a shaft;	So that he became lean and dry as is a stick;
His eyen holwe and grisly to biholde,	His eyes sunken and grisly to behold,
His hewe falow and pale as asshen colde,	His hue sickly yellow and pale as cold ashes,
And solitarie he was and evere allone,	And he was solitary and ever alone,
And waillynge al the nyght, makynge his mone;	And wailing all the night, making his moan;
And if he herde song or instrument,	And if he heard song or instrument,
Thanne wolde he wepe, he myghte nat be stent.	Then would he weep, he could not be stopped.
So feble eek were his spiritz, and so lowe,	So feeble also were his spirits, and so low,
And chaunged so, that no man koude knowe	And changed so, that no man could know
His speche nor his voys, though men it herde.	His speech nor his voice, though men heard it.
And in his geere for al the world he ferde	And in his behavior for all the world he fared
Nat oonly lik the loveris maladye	Not only like the lover's malady
Of Hereos, but rather lyk manye,	Of Hereos, but rather like mania,
Engendred of humour malencolik	Engendered by the melancholic humor
Biforen, in his celle fantastik.	In the front lobe, in his imagination.
And shortly, turned was al up so doun	And shortly, all was turned topsy-turvy
Bothe habit and eek disposicioun	Both the physical condition and also the mental disposition
Of hym, this woful lovere daun Arcite.	Of him, this woeful lover dan Arcite.
What sholde I al day of his wo endite?	Why should I all daylong write of his woe?
Whan he endured hadde a yeer or two	When he had endured a year or two
This crueel torment and this peyne and wo,	This cruel torment and this pain and woe,
At Thebes, in his contree, as I seyde,	At Thebes, in his country, as I said,
Upon a nyght in sleep as he hym leyde,	Upon one night as he laid himself in sleep,
Hym thoughte how that the wynged god Mercurie	It seemed to him that the winged god Mercury
Biforn hym stood and bad hym to be murie.	Stood before him and commanded him to be merry.
His slepy yerde in hond he bar uprighte;	His sleep-inducing staff he carried upright in his hand;
An hat he werede upon his heris brighte.	He wore a hat upon his bright hair.
Arrayed was this god, as he took keep,	This god was dressed, as he (Arcite) noticed,
As he was whan that Argus took his sleep;	As he was when he put Argus to sleep;
And seyde hym thus: "To Atthenes shaltou wende,	And said to him thus: "To Athens shalt thou go,
Ther is thee shapen of thy wo an ende."	Where an end of thy woe is destined for thee."
And with that word Arcite wook and sterte.	And with that word Arcite awoke and leaped up.
"Now trewely, hou soore that me smerte,"	"Now truly, however sorely it may pain me,"
Quod he, "to Atthenes right now wol I fare,	Said he, "I will go to Athens right now,
Ne for the drede of deeth shal I nat spare	Nor shall I refrain for the dread of death
To se my lady, that I love and serve.	From seeing my lady, whom I love and serve.
In hire presence I recche nat to sterve."	In her presence I care not if I die."
And with that word he caughte a greet mirour,	And with that word he picked up a large mirror,
And saugh that chaunged was al his colour,	And saw that all his color was changed,
And saugh his visage al in another kynde.	And saw his visage all (changed) to another sort.
And right anon it ran hym in his mynde,	And right away it ran to him in his mind,
That, sith his face was so disfigured	That, since his face was so disfigured
Of maladye the which he hadde endured,	By the malady which he had endured,
He myghte wel, if that he bar hym lowe,	He might well, if he conducted himself humbly,
Lyve in Atthenes everemoore unknowe,	Live in Athens evermore unknown,
And seen his lady wel ny day by day.	And see his lady almost every day.
And right anon he chaunged his array,	And right away he changed his clothing,
And cladde hym as a povre laborer,	And clad himself as a poor laborer,
And al allone, save oonly a squier	And all alone, except only a squire
That knew his privetee and al his cas,	Who knew his private affairs and all his situation,
Which was disgised povrely as he was,	Who was disguised as poorly as he was,
To Atthenes is he goon the nexte way.	To Athens he is gone the nearest way.
And to the court he wente upon a day,	And to the court he went upon a day,
And at the gate he profreth his servyse	And at the gate he offers his service
To drugge and drawe, what so men wol devyse.	To drudge and draw water, whatever men will command.

Wel koude he hewen wode, and water bere,	He could well hew wood, and carry water,

And therto he was long and big of bones	And moreover he was tall and strong of bones
To doon that any wight kan hym devyse.	To do what any one can command him.
A yeer or two he was in this servyse,	A year or two he was in this service,
Page of the chambre of Emelye the brighte,	Page of the chamber of Emelye the bright,
And Philostrate he seyde that he highte.	And he said that he was called Philostrate.
But half so wel biloved a man as he	But half so well beloved a man as he
Ne was ther nevere in court of his degree;	Was never in court (anyone) of his rank;
He was so gentil of condicioun	He was so noble in manner
That thurghout al the court was his renoun.	That his fame was (spread) throughout all the court .
They seyden that it were a charitee	They said that it would be a act of charity
That Theseus wolde enhauncen his degree,	If Theseus would advance his rank,
And putten hym in worshipful servyse,	And put him in noble employment,
Ther as he myghte his vertu excercise.	Where he could exercise his abilities.
And thus withinne a while his name is spronge,	And thus within a short time his fame is sprung,
Bothe of his dedes and his goode tonge,	Both for his deeds and his good speech,

That of his chambre he made hym a squier,	That he has made him a squire of his chamber,
And gaf hym gold to mayntene his degree.	And gave him gold to maintain (a life style suitable to) his rank.
And eek men broghte hym out of his contree,	And also men brought him out of his country,
From yeer to yeer, ful pryvely his rente;	From year to year, very secretly, his income;
But honestly and slyly he it spente,	But properly and slyly he spent it,
That no man wondred how that he it hadde.	So that no man wondered how he acquired it.
And thre yeer in this wise his lif he ladde,	And three years in this manner he led his life,
And bar hym so, in pees and eek in werre,	And conducted himself so that, in peace and also in war,
Ther was no man that Theseus hath derre.	There was no man whom Theseus holds dearer.
And in this blisse lete I now Arcite,	And in this bliss I now leave Arcite,

But Palamon, that love destreyneth so	But Palamon, whom love so afflicts

And eek therto he is a prisoner	And also moreover he is a prisoner
Perpetuelly, noght oonly for a yer.	Perpetually, not just for a year.
Who koude ryme in Englyssh proprely	Who could rime in English properly
His martirdom? For sothe it am nat I;	His martyrdom? In truth it is not I;
Therfore I passe as lightly as I may.	Therefore I pass on as quickly as I can.

The thridde nyght (as olde bookes seyn,	The third night (as old books say,

Were it by aventure or destynee --	Whether it was by chance or fate --
As, whan a thyng is shapen, it shal be --	As, when a thing is pre-ordained, it must be --

By helpyng of a freend, brak his prisoun	With the help of a friend, broke out of his prison
And fleeth the citee faste as he may go.	And flees the city as fast as he can go.

Of a clarree maad of a certeyn wyn,	Of a spiced and sweetened drink made of a certain wine,
With nercotikes and opie of Thebes fyn,	With narcotics and pure opium of Thebes,
That al that nyght, thogh that men wolde him shake,	That all that night, though men would shake him,
The gayler sleep; he myghte nat awake.	The jailer slept; he could not awake.

The nyght was short and faste by the day	The night was short and very close to the day
That nedes cost he moot hymselven hyde,	So that by necessity he must hide himself,
And til a grove faste ther bisyde	And to a grove close by
With dredeful foot thanne stalketh Palamon.	With fearful foot then stalks Palamon.
For, shortly, this was his opinion:	For, shortly, this was his idea:
That in that grove he wolde hym hyde al day,	That in that grove he would hide himself all day,
And in the nyght thanne wolde he take his way	And in the night then he would take his way
To Thebes-ward, his freendes for to preye	Toward Thebes, to pray his friends
On Theseus to helpe him to werreye;	To help him to wage war on Theseus;
And shortly, outher he wolde lese his lif	And shortly, he would either lose his life
Or wynnen Emelye unto his wyf.	Or win Emelye to be his wife.
This is th'effect and his entente pleyn.	This is the purpose and his full intent.
Now wol I turne to Arcite ageyn,	Now I will turn again to Arcite,
That litel wiste how ny that was his care,	That little knew how near his trouble was,
Til that Fortune had broght him in the snare.	To which Fortune had brought him in the snare.
The bisy larke, messager of day,	The busy lark, messenger of day,
Salueth in hir song the morwe gray,	Salutes the morning gray in her song,
And firy Phebus riseth up so bright	And fiery Phoebus rises up so bright
That al the orient laugheth of the light,	That all the orient laughs because of the light,
And with his stremes dryeth in the greves	And with his rays dries in the groves
The silver dropes hangynge on the leves.	The silver drops hanging on the leaves.
And Arcita, that in the court roial	And Arcite, who in the royal court
With Theseus is principal squier,	With Theseus is chief squire,
Is risen and looketh on the myrie day.	Is risen and looks on the merry day.
And for to doon his observaunce to May,	And to do his observance to May,
Remembrynge on the poynt of his desir,	Meditating on the object of his desire,
He on a courser, startlynge as the fir,	He on a war horse, leaping about like the fire,
Is riden into the feeldes hym to pleye,	Has ridden into the fields to amuse himself,
Out of the court, were it a myle or tweye.	Out of the court, about a mile or two.
And to the grove of which that I yow tolde	And to the grove of which I told you
By aventure his wey he gan to holde	By chance he began to hold his way
To maken hym a gerland of the greves,	To make himself a garland of the branches,
Were it of wodebynde or hawethorn leves,	Were it of woodbine or hawthorn leaves,
And loude he song ayeyn the sonne shene:	And loud he sang in the bright sun:
"May, with alle thy floures and thy grene,	"May, with all thy flowers and thy greenery,
Welcome be thou, faire, fresshe May,	Welcome be thou, fair, fresh May,
In hope that I som grene gete may."	In hope that I can get something green."
And from his courser, with a lusty herte,	And from his war horse, with an eager heart,
Into the grove ful hastily he sterte,	He rushed into the grove hastily,
And in a path he rometh up and doun,	And in a path he roams up and down,
Ther as by aventure this Palamoun	Where by chance this Palamon
Was in a bussh, that no man myghte hym se,	Was in a thicket, so that no man could see him,
For soore afered of his deeth was he.	For he was sorely afraid of his death.
No thyng ne knew he that it was Arcite;	In no way did he know that it was Arcite;
God woot he wolde have trowed it ful lite.	God knows he would scarcely have believed it
But sooth is seyd, go sithen many yeres,	But truly it is said, since many years ago,
That "feeld hath eyen and the wode hath eres."	That "field has eyes and the wood has ears."
It is ful fair a man to bere hym evene,	It is very good for a man to act calmly,
For al day meeteth men at unset stevene.	For every day people meet at unexpected times.
Ful litel woot Arcite of his felawe,	Arcite knows full little of his fellow,
That was so ny to herknen al his sawe,	Who was near enough to hear all his speech,
For in the bussh he sitteth now ful stille.	For in the thicket he sits now very still.
Whan that Arcite hadde romed al his fille,	When Arcite had roamed all his fill,
And songen al the roundel lustily,	And sung all the rondel cheerfully,
Into a studie he fil sodeynly,	He fell suddenly into a state of anxiety,
As doon thise loveres in hir queynte geres,	As these lovers do in their strange manners,
Now in the crope, now doun in the breres,	Now in the tree top, now down in the briars,
Now up, now doun, as boket in a welle.	Now up, now down, like a bucket in a well.
Right as the Friday, soothly for to telle,	Exactly like the Friday, truly for to tell,
Now it shyneth, now it reyneth faste,	Now it shines, now it rains hard,
Right so kan geery Venus overcaste	Just so can fickle Venus sadden
The hertes of hir folk; right as hir day	The hearts of her folk; just as her day
Is gereful, right so chaungeth she array.	Is changeable, just so she changes her array.
Selde is the Friday al the wowke ylike.	Friday is seldom like all the rest of the week.
Whan that Arcite had songe, he gan to sike	When Arcite had sung, he began to sigh
And sette hym doun withouten any moore.	And sat himself down without any more.
"Allas," quod he, "that day that I was bore!	"Alas," he said, "that day that I was born!
How longe, Juno, thurgh thy crueltee,	How long, Juno, through thy cruelty,
Woltow werreyen Thebes the citee?	Wilt thou make war on the city of Thebes?
Allas, ybroght is to confusioun	Alas, to ruin is brought
The blood roial of Cadme and Amphioun --	The royal blood of Cadmus and Amphion --
Of Cadmus, which that was the firste man	Of Cadmus, who was the first man
That Thebes bulte, or first the toun bigan,	Who built Thebes, before the town first began,
And of the citee first was crouned kyng.	And first was crowned king of the city.
Of his lynage am I and his ofspryng	I am of his lineage and his offspring
By verray ligne, as of the stok roial,	By true lineage, of the royal family,
And now I am so caytyf and so thral,	And now I am so wretched and so enslaved,
That he that is my mortal enemy,	That he who is my mortal enemy,
I serve hym as his squier povrely.	I meekly serve him as his squire.
And yet dooth Juno me wel moore shame,	And yet Juno does me much more shame,
For I dar noght biknowe myn owene name;	For I dare not acknowledge my own name;
But ther as I was wont to highte Arcite,	But whereas I was accustomed to be called Arcite,
Now highte I Philostrate, noght worth a myte.	Now I am called Philostrate, not worth a penny.
Allas, thou felle Mars! Allas, Juno!	Alas, thou fierce Mars! Alas, Juno!
Thus hath youre ire oure lynage al fordo,	Thus has your anger destroyed all our lineage,
Save oonly me and wrecched Palamoun,	Save only me and wretched Palamon,
That Theseus martireth in prisoun.	Whom Theseus torments in prison.
And over al this, to sleen me outrely	And in addition to all this, to slay me utterly
Love hath his firy dart so brennyngly	Love has his fiery dart so ardently
Ystiked thurgh my trewe, careful herte	Stabbed through my faithful, sorrowful heart
That shapen was my deeth erst than my sherte.	That my death was destined before my first garment was made.
Ye sleen me with youre eyen, Emelye!	You slay me with your eyes, Emelye!
Ye been the cause wherfore that I dye.	You are the cause by which I die.
Of al the remenant of myn oother care	Of all the rest of my other troubles
Ne sette I nat the montance of a tare,	I do not reckon at the value of a weed,
So that I koude doon aught to youre plesaunce."	Provided that I could do anything to please you."
And with that word he fil doun in a traunce	And with that word he fell down in a trance
A longe tyme, and after he up sterte.	A long time, and afterwards he leaped up.
This Palamoun, that thoughte that thurgh his herte	This Palamon, that thought that through his heart
He felte a coold swerd sodeynliche glyde,	He felt a cold sword suddenly glide,
For ire he quook; no lenger wolde he byde.	For anger he trembled; no longer would he wait.
And whan that he had herd Arcites tale,	And when he had heard Arcite's tale,
As he were wood, with face deed and pale,	As if he were mad, with face dead and pale,
He stirte hym up out of the buskes thikke	He leaped up out of the thick bushes
And seide: "Arcite, false traytour wikke,	And said: "Arcite, false, wicked traitor,
Now artow hent, that lovest my lady so,	Now art thou taken, who lovest my lady so,
For whom that I have al this peyne and wo,	For whom that I have all this pain and woe,
And art my blood, and to my conseil sworn,	And art of my blood, and sworn to be in my confidence,
As I ful ofte have told thee heerbiforn,	As I full often have told thee before now,
And hast byjaped heere duc Theseus,	And hast tricked here duke Theseus,
And falsly chaunged hast thy name thus!	And thus hast falsely changed thy name!
I wol be deed, or elles thou shalt dye.	I will be dead, or else thou shalt die.
Thou shalt nat love my lady Emelye,	Thou shalt not love my lady Emelye,
But I wol love hire oonly and namo;	But I will love her only and no other;
For I am Palamon, thy mortal foo.	For I am Palamon, thy mortal foe.
And though that I no wepene have in this place,	And though I have no weapon in this place,
But out of prison am astert by grace,	But out of prison am escaped by good luck,
I drede noght that outher thow shalt dye,	I doubt not that either thou shalt dye,
Or thow ne shalt nat loven Emelye.	Either thou shalt not love Emelye,
Chees which thou wolt, or thou shalt nat asterte!"	Choose which thou wish, or thou shalt not escape!"
This Arcite, with ful despitous herte,	This Arcite, with full spiteful heart,
Whan he hym knew, and hadde his tale herd,	When he knew him, and had heard his tale,
As fiers as leon pulled out his swerd,	As fierce as a lion pulled out his sword,
And seyde thus: "By God that sit above,	And said thus: "By God who sits above,
Nere it that thou art sik and wood for love,	Were it not that thou art sick and mad for love,
And eek that thow no wepne hast in this place,	And also because thou hast no weapon in this place,
Thou sholdest nevere out of this grove pace,	Thou shouldest never walk out of this grove,
That thou ne sholdest dyen of myn hond.	Rather thou shouldest die of my hand.
For I defye the seurete and the bond	For I repudiate the pledge and the bond
Which that thou seist that I have maad to thee.	Which thou sayest that I have made to thee.
What! Verray fool, thynk wel that love is free,	Lo! True fool, think well that love is free,
And I wol love hire maugree al thy myght!	And I will love her in spite of all thy might!
But for as muche thou art a worthy knyght	But for as much as thou art a worthy knight
And wilnest to darreyne hire by bataille,	And desire to decide the right to her by battle,
Have heer my trouthe; tomorwe I wol nat faille,	Have here my pledge; tomorrow I will not fail,
Withoute wityng of any oother wight,	Without the knowledge of any other person,
That heere I wol be founden as a knyght,	But here I will be found as a knight,
And bryngen harneys right ynough for thee;	And bring armor right enough for thee;
And ches the beste, and leef the worste for me.	And choose the best, and leave the worst for me.
And mete and drynke this nyght wol I brynge	And food and drink this night will I bring
Ynough for thee, and clothes for thy beddynge.	Enough for thee, and bed-clothes for thy bedding.
And if so be that thou my lady wynne,	And if it so be that thou win my lady,
And sle me in this wode ther I am inne,	And slay me in this wood where I am in,
Thow mayst wel have thy lady as for me."	Thou mayest well have thy lady as far as I am concerned."
This Palamon answerde, "I graunte it thee."	This Palamon answered, "I agree."
And thus they been departed til amorwe,	And thus they are departed until morning,
Whan ech of hem had leyd his feith to borwe.	When each of them had laid his faith as a pledge.
O Cupide, out of alle charitee!	O Cupid, devoid of all kindness to others!
O regne, that wolt no felawe have with thee!	O reign, that will have no partner with thee!
Ful sooth is seyd that love ne lordshipe	Full truly it is said that love nor lordship
Wol noght, his thankes, have no felaweshipe.	Will not, willingly, have any partnership.
Wel fynden that Arcite and Palamoun.	Arcite and Palamon well find that (to be true).
Arcite is riden anon unto the toun,	Arcite has ridden immediately into the town,
And on the morwe, er it were dayes light,	And on the morning, before it was day's light,
Ful prively two harneys hath he dight,	Very secretly he has prepared two sets of armor,
Bothe suffisaunt and mete to darreyne	Both sufficient and suitable to decide
The bataille in the feeld bitwix hem tweyne;	The battle in the field between them two;
And on his hors, allone as he was born,	And on his horse, alone as he was born,
He carieth al the harneys hym biforn.	He carries all the armor before him.
And in the grove, at tyme and place yset,	And in the grove, at time and place set,
This Arcite and this Palamon ben met.	This Arcite and this Palamon are met.
To chaungen gan the colour in hir face;	The color in their faces began to change;
Right as the hunters in the regne of Trace,	Just as the hunters in the reign of Thrace,
That stondeth at the gappe with a spere,	He who stands at the gap in the forrest with a spear,
Whan hunted is the leon or the bere,	When the lion or the bear is hunted,
And hereth hym come russhyng in the greves,	And hears him come rushing in the bushes,
And breketh bothe bowes and the leves,	And breaks both boughs and the leaves,
And thynketh, "Heere cometh my mortal enemy!	And thinks, "Here comes my mortal enemy!
Withoute faille, he moot be deed, or I,	Without fail, he must be dead, or I,
For outher I moot sleen hym at the gappe,	For either I must slay him at the gap,
Or he moot sleen me, if that me myshappe."	Or he must slay me, if I suffer misfortune."
So ferden they in chaungyng of hir hewe,	So fared they in changing colors of their faces,
As fer as everich of hem oother knewe.	When each of them knew the other.
Ther nas no good day, ne no saluyng,	There was no 'good day,' nor no salutations,
But streight, withouten word or rehersyng,	But straightway, without word or conversing,
Everich of hem heelp for to armen oother	Each one of them helped to arm the other
As freendly as he were his owene brother;	As friendly as if he were his own brother;
And after that, with sharpe speres stronge	And after that, with sharp strong spears
They foynen ech at oother wonder longe.	They thrust at each other a wonderfully long time.
Thou myghtest wene that this Palamon	Thou mightest suppose that this Palamon
In his fightyng were a wood leon,	In his fighting was a mad lion,
And as a crueel tigre was Arcite;	And Arcite was like a cruel tiger;
As wilde bores gonne they to smyte,	They began to smite like wild boars,
That frothen whit as foom for ire wood.	That froth at the mouth white as foam for mad anger.
Up to the ancle foghte they in hir blood.	They fought up to the ankle in their blood.
And in this wise I lete hem fightyng dwelle,	And in this manner I leave them to remain fighting,
And forth I wole of Theseus yow telle.	And forth I will tell you of Theseus.
The destinee, ministre general,	The destiny, general minister,
That executeth in the world over al	That executes in the world everywhere
The purveiaunce that God hath seyn biforn,	The providence that God has foreseen,
So strong it is that, though the world had sworn	So strong it is that, though the world had sworn
The contrarie of a thyng by ye or nay,	The contrary of a thing by yes or no,
Yet somtyme it shal fallen on a day	Yet sometimes it shall happen on one day
That falleth nat eft withinne a thousand yeer.	That happens not again in a thousand years.
For certeinly, oure appetites heer,	For certainly, our desires here,
Be it of werre, or pees, or hate, or love,	Be it of war, or peace, or hate, or love,
Al is this reuled by the sighte above.	All this is ruled by the foresight above.
This mene I now by myghty Theseus,	I mean this now in regard to mighty Theseus,
That for to hunten is so desirus,	Who is so desirous to hunt,
And namely at the grete hert in May,	And especially at the large hart in May,
That in his bed ther daweth hym no day	That in his bed there dawns for him no day
That he nys clad, and redy for to ryde	That he is not clad, and ready to ride
With hunte and horn and houndes hym bisyde.	With huntsman and horn and hounds beside him.
For in his huntyng hath he swich delit	For in his hunting he has such delight
That it is al his joye and appetit	That it is all his joy and desire
To been hymself the grete hertes bane,	To be himself the large hart's slayer,
For after Mars he serveth now Dyane.	For next to Mars he now serves Diana.
Cleer was the day, as I have toold er this,	The day was clear, as I have told before this,
And Theseus with alle joye and blis,	And Theseus with all joy and bliss,
With his Ypolita, the faire queene,	With his Ypolita, the faire queen,
And Emelye, clothed al in grene,	And Emelye, clothed all in green,
On huntyng be they riden roially.	On hunting they are ridden royally.
And to the grove that stood ful faste by,	And to the grove that stood very close by,
In which ther was an hert, as men hym tolde,	In which there was a hart, so people told him,
Duc Theseus the streighte wey hath holde.	Duke Theseus has held the straight way.
And to the launde he rideth hym ful right,	And directly to the glade he rides,
For thider was the hert wont have his flight,	For through there the hart was accustomed to take his escape,
And over a brook, and so forth on his weye.	And (flee) over a brook, and so forth on his way.
This duc wol han a cours at hym or tweye	This duke will have a run or two at him
With houndes swiche as that hym list comaunde.	With such hounds as he pleases to command.
And whan this duc was come unto the launde,	And when this duke was come unto the glade,
Under the sonne he looketh, and anon	He looks toward the sun, and immediately
He was war of Arcite and Palamon,	He was aware of Arcite and Palamon,
That foughten breme as it were bores two.	Who fought as fiercely as if it were two wild boars.
The brighte swerdes wenten to and fro	The bright swords went to and fro
So hidously that with the leeste strook	So hideously that with the weakest stroke
It semed as it wolde felle an ook.	It seemed as if it would fell an oak.
But what they were, no thyng he ne woot.	But who they were, he knew nothing.
This duc his courser with his spores smoot,	This duke smote his warhorse with his spurs,
And at a stert he was bitwix hem two,	And with a sudden leap he was between them two,
And pulled out a swerd and cride, "Hoo!	And pulled out a sword and cried, "Stop!
Namoore, up peyne of lesynge of youre heed!	No more, on the penalty of the loss of your head!
By myghty Mars, he shal anon be deed	By mighty Mars, he shall at once be dead
That smyteth any strook that I may seen.	Who smites any stroke that I can see.
But telleth me what myster men ye been,	But tell me what sort of men you are,
That been so hardy for to fighten heere	Who are so bold as to fight here
Withouten juge or oother officere,	Without judge or other officer,
As it were in a lystes roially."	As it would be in a properly conducted duel,"
This Palamon answerde hastily	This Palamon answered hastily
And seyde, "Sire, what nedeth wordes mo?	And said, "Sire, what more words are needed?
We have the deeth disserved bothe two.	We have deserved the death, both of us two.
Two woful wrecches been we, two caytyves,	Two woeful wretches are we, two miserable people,
That been encombred of oure owene lyves;	Who are burdened down by our own lives;
And as thou art a rightful lord and juge,	And as thou art a rightful lord and judge,
Ne yif us neither mercy ne refuge,	Give us neither mercy nor refuge,
But sle me first, for seinte charitee!	But slay me first, by holy charity!
But sle my felawe eek as wel as me;	But slay my fellow also as well as me;
Or sle hym first, for though thow knowest it lite,	Or slay him first, for though thou little knowest it,
This is thy mortal foo, this is Arcite,	This is thy mortal foe, this is Arcite,
That fro thy lond is banysshed on his heed,	Who is banished from thy land on (pain of losing) his head,
For which he hath deserved to be deed.	For which he has deserved to be dead.
For this is he that cam unto thy gate	For this is he that came unto thy gate
And seyde that he highte Philostrate.	And said that he was called Philostrate.
Thus hath he japed thee ful many a yer,	Thus has he tricked thee for many years,
And thou hast maked hym thy chief squier;	And thou hast made him thy chief squire;
And this is he that loveth Emelye.	And this is he that loves Emelye.
For sith the day is come that I shal dye,	For since the day is come that I must dye,
I make pleynly my confessioun	I make plainly my confession
That I am thilke woful Palamoun	That I am that same woeful Palamon
That hath thy prisoun broken wikkedly.	That wickedly has broken (out of) thy prison.
I am thy mortal foo, and it am I	I am thy mortal foe, and it is I
That loveth so hoote Emelye the brighte	Who loves the beautiful Emelye so passionately
That I wol dye present in hir sighte.	That I will die at this moment in her sight.
Wherfore I axe deeth and my juwise;	Therefore I ask death and my judicial sentence;
But sle my felawe in the same wise,	But slay my fellow in the same way,
For bothe han we deserved to be slayn."	For we have both deserved to be slain."
This worthy duc answerde anon agayn,	This worthy duke answered at once in reply,
And seyde, "This is a short conclusioun.	And said, "This is a brief (easy) decision.
Youre owene mouth, by youre confessioun,	Your own mouth, by your confession,
Hath dampned yow, and I wol it recorde;	Has condemned you, and I will pronounce it;
It nedeth noght to pyne yow with the corde.	There is no deed to torture you with the cord.
Ye shal be deed, by myghty Mars the rede!"	You shall be dead, by mighty Mars the red!"
The queene anon, for verray wommanhede,	The queen at once, for true womanliness,
Gan for to wepe, and so dide Emelye,	Began to weep, and so did Emelye,
And alle the ladyes in the compaignye.	And all the ladies in the company.
Greet pitee was it, as it thoughte hem alle,	Great pity was it, as it seemed to them all,
That evere swich a chaunce sholde falle,	That ever such a misfortune should occur,
For gentil men they were of greet estaat,	For they were gentle men of high rank,
And no thyng but for love was this debaat;	And this debate was for nothing but love;
And saugh hir blody woundes wyde and soore,	And saw their bloody wounds wide and sore,
And alle crieden, bothe lasse and moore,	And all cried, both low ranking and high,
"Have mercy, Lord, upon us wommen alle!"	"Have mercy, Lord, upon all of us women!"
And on hir bare knees adoun they falle	And they fall down on their bare knees
And wolde have kist his feet ther as he stood;	And would have kissed his feet there where he stood;
Til at the laste aslaked was his mood,	Until at the last his mood was calmed,
For pitee renneth soone in gentil herte.	For pity comes soon to a gentle heart.
And though he first for ire quook and sterte,	And though he first for anger shook and trembled,
He hath considered shortly, in a clause,	He has considered shortly, in brief,
The trespas of hem bothe, and eek the cause,	The trespass of them both, and also the cause,
And although that his ire hir gilt accused,	And although his anger reproached them for their guilt,
Yet in his resoun he hem bothe excused,	Yet in his reason he excused them both,
As thus: he thoghte wel that every man	As thus: he thought well that every man
Wol helpe hymself in love, if that he kan,	Will help himself in love, if he can,
And eek delivere hymself out of prisoun.	And also deliver himself out of prison.
And eek his herte hadde compassioun	And also his heart had compassion
Of wommen, for they wepen evere in oon,	Of women, for they weep continually,
And in his gentil herte he thoughte anon,	And in his gentle heart he thought straightway,
And softe unto hymself he seyde, "Fy	And softly to himself he said, "Fie
Upon a lord that wol have no mercy,	Upon a lord that will have no mercy,
But been a leon, bothe in word and dede,	But be a lion, both in word and deed,
To hem that been in repentaunce and drede,	To those who are in repentance and fear,
As wel as to a proud despitous man	As well as to a proud, spiteful man
That wol mayntene that he first bigan.	Who will persist in what he first began.
That lord hath litel of discrecioun,	That lord has little sound judgment,
That in swich cas kan no divisioun	That in such cases knows no distinctions
But weyeth pride and humblesse after oon."	But considers pride and humility equal."
And shortly, whan his ire is thus agoon,	And shortly, when his anger is thus gone,
He gan to looken up with eyen lighte	He began to look up with bright eyes
And spak thise same wordes al on highte:	And spoke these same words all aloud:
"The god of love, a benedicite!	"The god of love, ah, bless my soul!
How myghty and how greet a lord is he!	How mighty and how great a lord is he!
Ayeyns his myght ther gayneth none obstacles.	Against his power there avail no obstacles.
He may be cleped a god for his myracles,	He may be called a god for his miracles,
For he kan maken, at his owene gyse,	For he can make, as he pleases,
Of everich herte as that hym list divyse.	Of every heart whatever he wants to devise.
Lo heere this Arcite and this Palamoun,	Lo here this Arcite and this Palamon,
That quitly weren out of my prisoun,	Who freely were out of my prison,
And myghte han lyved in Thebes roially,	And could have lived royally in Thebes,
And witen I am hir mortal enemy,	And know I am their mortal enemy,
And that hir deth lith in my myght also,	And that their death lies in my power also,
And yet hath love, maugree hir eyen two,	And yet has Love, despite anything they could do,
Broght hem hyder bothe for to dye.	Brought them both hither to die.
Now looketh, is nat that an heigh folye?	Now look, is that not a great folly?
Who may been a fool but if he love?	Who can be a fool unless he is in love?
Bihoold, for Goddes sake that sit above,	Behold, for the sake of God who sits above,
Se how they blede! Be they noght wel arrayed?	See how they bleed! Are they not in fine condition?
Thus hath hir lord, the god of love, ypayed	Thus has their lord, the god of love, paid
Hir wages and hir fees for hir servyse!	Their wages and their fees for their service!
And yet they wenen for to been ful wyse	And yet they consider themselves very wise,
That serven love, for aught that may bifalle.	Those who serve love, whatever may happen.
But this is yet the beste game of alle,	But this is yet the best joke of all,
That she for whom they han this jolitee	That she for whom they have this sport
Kan hem therfore as muche thank as me.	Owes them as much gratitude for this as she owes me.
She woot namoore of al this hoote fare,	She knows no more of all this passionate business,
By God, than woot a cokkow or an hare!	By God, than knows a cuckoo or a hare!
But all moot ben assayed, hoot and coold;	But all must be tried, hot or cold;
A man moot ben a fool, or yong or oold --	A man must be a fool, either young or old --
I woot it by myself ful yore agon,	I know it by my own experience very long ago,
For in my tyme a servant was I oon.	For in my time I was a servant (of love).

And al hir bisy torment, and hir fir	And all their intense torment, and their fire
Be queynt, or turned in another place.	Will be quenched, or turned to another place.

The fires brenne upon the auter cleere,	The fires burn brightly upon the altar,
Whil Emelye was thus in hir preyere.	While Emelye was thus in her prayer.
But sodeynly she saugh a sighte queynte,	But suddenly she saw a curious sight,
For right anon oon of the fyres queynte	For right away one of the fires quenched
And quyked agayn, and after that anon	And rekindled again, and after that straightway
That oother fyr was queynt and al agon;	That other fire was quenched and all gone;
And as it queynte it made a whistelynge,	And as it quenched it made a roaring sound,
As doon thise wete brondes in hir brennynge,	As these wet brands do in their burning,
And at the brondes ende out ran anon	And at the brand's end (the fire) ran out straightway
As it were blody dropes many oon;	As if it were many bloody drops;
For which so soore agast was Emelye	For which so sorely frightened was Emelye
That she was wel ny mad and gan to crye,	That she was well nigh mad and began to cry,
For she ne wiste what it signyfied,	For she did not know what it signified,
But oonly for the feere thus hath she cried,	But simply for fear has she cried thus,

With bowe in honde, right as an hunteresse,	With bow in hand, just like a huntress,

Shulle thee declaren, er that thou go henne,	Shall declare to thee, before thou go hence,
Thyn aventure of love, as in this cas."	Thy destiny concerning love, as in this situation."
And with that word, the arwes in the caas	And with that word, the arrows in the quiver
Of the goddesse clateren faste and rynge,	Of the goddess clatter fast and ring,
And forth she wente and made a vanysshynge;	And forth she went and vanished;
For which this Emelye astoned was,	For which this Emelye was astonished,
And seyde, "What amounteth this, allas?	And said, "What does this mean, alas?
I putte me in thy proteccioun,	I put me in thy protection,
Dyane, and in thy disposicioun."	Diana, and in thy power."
And hoom she goth anon the nexte weye.	And home she goes at once the nearest way.

With pitous herte and heigh devocioun,	With sorrowful heart and intense devotion,
Right thus to Mars he seyde his orisoun:	Right thus to Mars he said his prayer:
"O stronge god, that in the regnes colde	"O strong god, who in the cold reigns
Of Trace honoured art and lord yholde,	Of Thrace art honored and considered lord,

Of faire, yonge, fresshe Venus free,	Of fair, young, fresh Venus the noble,
And haddest hire in armes at thy wille --	And haddest her in arms as you wished --
Although thee ones on a tyme mysfille,	Although once things went wrong for you,
Whan Vulcanus hadde caught thee in his las	When Vulcan had caught thee in his snare
And foond thee liggynge by his wyf, allas! --	And found thee lying by his wife, alas! --

Ne reccheth nevere wher I synke or fleete.	Nor cares never whether I sink or swim.

Of thee ne may my strengthe noght availle.	Of thee my strength can not avail.
Thanne help me, lord, tomorwe in my bataille,	Then help me, lord, tomorrow in my battle,
For thilke fyr that whilom brente thee,	For that same fire that once burned thee,

Of any place, and alwey moost labouren	Over any place, and always most labor
In thy plesaunce and in thy craftes stronge,	In thy pleasure and in thy strong crafts,
And in thy temple I wol my baner honge	And in thy temple I will hang my banner
And alle the armes of my compaignye,	And all the arms of my company,
And everemo, unto that day I dye,	And evermore, until that day I die,
Eterne fir I wol bifore thee fynde.	Eternal fire I will provide before thee (on your altar).
And eek to this avow I wol me bynde:	And also I will bind myself to this vow:

Of rasour nor of shere, I wol thee yive,	Of razor nor of shears, I will give thee,
And ben thy trewe servant whil I lyve.	And be thy true servant while I live.
Now, lord, have routhe upon my sorwes soore;	Now, lord, have pity upon my painful sorrows;
Yif me [victorie]; I aske thee namoore."	Give me victory; I ask of thee no more."

Bitwixe Venus, the goddesse of love,	Between Venus, the goddess of love,

Al be it that it is agayn his kynde,	Although it is against his natural disposition,
Of al this strif he gan remedie fynde.	He found a remedy for all this strife.

Whan he is siker of his goode name;	When he is sure of his good name;
Thanne hath he doon his freend, ne hym, no shame.	Then he has not done his friend, nor himself, any shame.
And gladder oghte his freend been of his deeth,	And his friend ought to be more pleased with his death,

Of what hous be ye, by youre fader kyn?	Of what monastic order are you, by your father's kin?
I vowe to God, thou hast a ful fair skyn;	I vow to God, thou hast a very handsome complexion;
It is a gentil pasture ther thow goost.	It is a noble pasture where thou goest to eat.
Thou art nat lyk a penant or a goost:	Thou art not like a penitent or a ghost:
Upon my feith, thou art som officer,	Upon my faith, thou art some officer,
Som worthy sexteyn, or som celerer,	Some worthy sexton, or some provisioner,
For by my fader soule, as to my doom,	For by my father's soul, according to my judgment,
Thou art a maister whan thou art at hoom;	Thou art a master when thou art at home;
No povre cloysterer, ne no novys,	No poor cloistered monk, nor no novice,
But a governour, wily and wys,	But a governor, wily and wise,
And therwithal of brawnes and of bones	And, in addition to that, of muscles and of bones
A wel farynge persone for the nones.	A very handsome person indeed.
I pray to God, yeve hym confusioun	I pray to God, give him ruination
That first thee broghte unto religioun!	Who first brought thee unto the monastic life!
Thou woldest han been a tredefowel aright.	Thou wouldest have been a chicken-copulator indeed,
Haddestow as greet a leeve as thou hast myght	If thou haddest as much permission as thou hast power
To parfourne al thy lust in engendrure,	To perform all thy desire in procreation,
Thou haddest bigeten ful many a creature.	Thou would have begotten very many a creature.
Allas, why werestow so wyd a cope?	Alas, why wearest thou so wide a cope?
God yeve me sorwe, but, and I were a pope,	God give me sorrow, unless, if I were a pope,
Nat oonly thou, but every myghty man,	Not only thou, but every mighty man,
Though he were shorn ful hye upon his pan,	Though he had a tonsure very prominently upon his head,
Sholde have a wyf; for al the world is lorn!	Should have a wife; for all the world is lost!
Religioun hath take up al the corn	Religion has taken up all the best
Of tredyng, and we borel men been shrympes.	At copulating, and we laymen are shrimps.
Of fieble trees ther comen wrecched ympes.	Of feeble trees there come weak offshoots.
This maketh that oure heires been so sklendre	This makes our heirs to be so scrawny
And feble that they may nat wel engendre.	And feeble that they can not well beget children.
This maketh that oure wyves wole assaye	This makes it that our wives want to try out
Religious folk, for ye mowe bettre paye	Folk in holy orders, for you can better pay
Of Venus paiementz than mowe we;	Venus' payments than we can;
God woot, no lussheburghes payen ye!	God knows, you pay with no inferior coins!
But be nat wrooth, my lord, though that I pleye.	But be not angry, my lord, though I am joking.
Ful ofte in game a sooth I have herd seye!"	Very often I have heard a truth said in jest!"
This worthy Monk took al in pacience,	This worthy Monk took all in patience,
And seyde, "I wol doon al my diligence,	And said, "I will devote all my efforts,
As fer as sowneth into honestee,	So far as it is conducive to propriety,
To telle yow a tale, or two, or three.	To tell you a tale, or two, or three.
And if yow list to herkne hyderward,	And if you desire to listen to me,
I wol yow seyn the lyf of Seint Edward;	I will tell you the life of Saint Edward;
Or ellis, first, tragedies wol I telle,	Or else, first, I will tell tragedies,
Of whiche I have an hundred in my celle.	Of which I have a hundred in my cell.
Tragedie is to seyn a certeyn storie,	Tragedy means a true narrative,
As olde bookes maken us memorie,	As old books make us remember,
Of hym that stood in greet prosperitee,	Of one who stood in great prosperity,
And is yfallen out of heigh degree	And is fallen out of high degree
Into myserie, and endeth wrecchedly.	Into misery, and ends wretchedly.
And they ben versified communely	And ordinarily they are in verses
Of six feet, which men clepen exametron.	Of six feet, which men call hexameters.
In prose eek been endited many oon,	Many are also composed in prose,
And eek in meetre in many a sondry wyse.	And also in meters of many and various sorts.
Lo, this declaryng oghte ynogh suffise.	Lo, this explanation ought to suffice enough.
"Now herkneth, if yow liketh for to heere.	"Now hearken, if it pleases you to hear.
But first I yow biseeke in this mateere,	But first I beseech you in this matter,
Though I by ordre telle nat thise thynges,	Though I do not tell these things in chronological order,
Be it of popes, emperours, or kynges,	Be it of popes, emperors, or kings,
After hir ages, as men writen fynde,	According to their times, as men find written,
But tellen hem som bifore and som bihynde,	But tell some of them before and some behind,
As it now comth unto my remembraunce,	As it now comes unto my memory,
Have me excused of myn ignoraunce."	Hold me excused for my ignorance."
Heere bigynneth the Monkes Tale.	Here begins the Monk's Tale.
I wol biwaille in manere of tragedie	I will bewail in the manner of tragedy
The harm of hem that stoode in heigh degree,	The harm of those who stood in high degree,
And fillen so that ther nas no remedie	And fell so that there was no remedy
To brynge hem out of hir adversitee.	To bring them out of their adversity.
For certein, whan that Fortune list to flee,	For certainly, when Fortune desires to flee,
Ther may no man the cours of hire withholde.	No man can withstand her onward movement.
Lat no man truste on blynd prosperitee;	Let no man trust on blind prosperity;
Be war by thise ensamples trewe and olde.	Take warning from these examples true and old.
At Lucifer, though he an angel were	At Lucifer, though he was an angel
And nat a man, at hym wol I bigynne.	And not a man, at him will I begin.
For though Fortune may noon angel dere,	For though Fortune may harm no angel,
From heigh degree yet fel he for his synne	From high degree yet for his sin he fell
Doun into helle, where he yet is inne.	Down into hell, in which he is yet.
O Lucifer, brightest of angels alle,	O Lucifer, brightest of all angels,
Now artow Sathanas, that mayst nat twynne	Now art thou Sathanas, that mayst not depart
Out of miserie, in which that thou art falle.	Out of misery, in which thou art fallen.
Loo Adam, in the feeld of Damyssene	Lo Adam, in the field of Damascus
With Goddes owene fynger wroght was he,	With God's own finger was he wrought,
And nat bigeten of mannes sperme unclene,	And not begotten of man's unclean sperm,
And welte al paradys savynge o tree.	And ruled all paradise save for one tree.
Hadde nevere worldly man so heigh degree	Had never worldly man so high degree
As Adam, til he for mysgovernaunce	As Adam, until he for misconduct
Was dryven out of hys hye prosperitee	Was driven out of his high prosperity
To labour, and to helle, and to meschaunce.	To labor, and to hell, and to ruin.
Loo Sampsoun, which that was annunciat	Lo Sampson, whose birth was announced
By th'angel longe er his nativitee,	By the angel long before his nativity,
And was to God Almyghty consecrat,	And was to God Almighty consecrated,
And stood in noblesse whil he myghte see.	And stood in noble estate while he could see.
Was nevere swich another as was hee,	There was never such another as was he,
To speke of strengthe, and therwith hardynesse;	To speak of strength, and bravery as well;
But to his wyves toolde he his secree,	But to his wives he told his secret,
Thurgh which he slow hymself for wrecchednesse.	Through which he slew himself for wretchedness.
Sampsoun, this noble almyghty champioun,	Sampson, this noble almighty champion,
Withouten wepen save his handes tweye,	Without any weapon save his two hands,
He slow and al torente the leoun,	He slew and tore all to pieces the lion,
Toward his weddyng walkynge by the weye.	(While he was) walking toward his wedding by the way.
His false wyf koude hym so plese and preye	His false wife could him so please and earnestly plead
Til she his conseil knew; and she, untrewe,	Until she knew his secrets; and she, untrue,
Unto his foos his conseil gan biwreye,	Unto his foes his secrets did betray,
And hym forsook, and took another newe.	And abandoned him, and took another new lover.
Thre hundred foxes took Sampson for ire,	Three hundred foxes Sampson took for ire,
And alle hir tayles he togydre bond,	And all their tails he tied together,
And sette the foxes tayles alle on fire,	And set the foxes' tails all on fire,
For he on every tayl had knyt a brond;	For he on every tail had tied a torch;
And they brende alle the cornes in that lond,	And they burned all the grain crops in that land,
And alle hire olyveres, and vynes eke.	And all their olive trees, and vines also.
A thousand men he slow eek with his hond,	A thousand men he slew also with his hand,
And hadde no wepen but an asses cheke.	And had no weapon but an ass's jawbone.
Whan they were slayn, so thursted hym that he	When they were slain, he was so thirsty that he
Was wel ny lorn, for which he gan to preye	Was well nigh lost, for which he prayed
That God wolde on his peyne han some pitee	That God would on his pain have some pity
And sende hym drynke, or elles moste he deye;	And send him drink, or else he must die;
And of this asses cheke, that was dreye,	And of this ass's jawbone, that was dry,
Out of a wang-tooth sprang anon a welle,	Out of a molar sprang right away a well,
Of which he drank ynogh, shortly to seye;	Of which he drank enough, shortly to say;
Thus heelp hym God, as Judicum can telle.	Thus God helped him, as The Book of Judges can tell.
By verray force at Gazan on a nyght,	By sheer force at Gaza on one night,
Maugree Philistiens of that citee,	Despite the Philistines of that city,
The gates of the toun he hath up plyght,	The gates of the town he has plucked up,
And on his bak ycaryed hem hath hee	And on his back he has carried them
Hye on an hill whereas men myghte hem see.	High on a hill where men could see them.
O noble, almyghty Sampsoun, lief and deere,	O noble, almighty Sampson, beloved and dear,
Had thou nat toold to wommen thy secree,	Had thou not told to women thy secret,
In al this world ne hadde been thy peere!	In all this world there had not been thy peer!
This Sampson nevere ciser drank ne wyn,	This Sampson never drank alcoholic drinks nor wine,
Ne on his heed cam rasour noon ne sheere,	Nor on his head came any razor or scissors,
By precept of the messager divyn,	By command of the divine messenger,
For alle his strengthes in his heeres weere.	For all his powers were in his hair.
And fully twenty wynter, yeer by yeere,	And fully twenty winters, year by year,
He hadde of Israel the governaunce.	He had the governance of Israel.
But soone shal he wepe many a teere,	But soon shall he weep many a tear,
For wommen shal hym bryngen to meschaunce!	For women shall bring him to misfortune!
Unto his lemman Dalida he tolde	Unto his sweetheart Dalilah he told
That in his heeris al his strengthe lay,	That all his strength lay in his hair,
And falsly to his foomen she hym solde.	And falsely to his foemen she sold him.
And slepynge in hir barm upon a day,	And sleeping on her bosom upon one day,
She made to clippe or shere his heres away,	She contrived to clip or shear his hair away,
And made his foomen al his craft espyen;	And made his foemen know all his craft;
And whan that they hym foond in this array,	And when they found him in this condition,
They bounde hym faste and putten out his yen.	They bound him securely and put out his eyes.
But er his heer were clipped or yshave,	But before his hair was clipped or shaven,
Ther was no boond with which men myghte him bynde;	There was no bond with which men could bind him;
But now is he in prison in a cave,	But now is he in prison in a cave,
Where-as they made hym at the queerne grynde.	Where they made him grind at the mill.
O noble Sampsoun, strongest of mankynde,	O noble Sampson, strongest of mankind,
O whilom juge, in glorie and in richesse!	O formerly judge, in glory and in riches!
Now maystow wepen with thyne eyen blynde,	Now mayst thou weep with thy blind eyes,
Sith thou fro wele art falle in wrecchednesse.	Since thou from prosperity art fallen into wretchedness.
The ende of this caytyf was as I shal seye.	The end of this captive was as I shall say.
His foomen made a feeste upon a day,	His foemen made a feast upon one day,
And made hym as hire fool biforn hem pleye;	And made him as their fool play before them;
And this was in a temple of greet array.	And this was in a temple of great magnificence.
But atte laste he made a foul affray,	But at the last he made a terrifying assault,
For he two pilers shook and made hem falle,	For he shook two pillars and made them fall,
And doun fil temple and al, and ther it lay --	And down fell temple and all, and there it lay --
And slow hymself, and eek his foomen alle.	And slew himself, and also all his foemen.
This is to seyn, the prynces everichoon,	This is to say, every one of the princes,
And eek thre thousand bodyes, were ther slayn	And also three thousand bodies, were there slain
With fallynge of the grete temple of stoon.	By the falling of the great temple of stone.
Of Sampson now wol I namoore sayn.	Of Sampson now I will say no more.
Beth war by this ensample oold and playn	Beware by this example old and plain
That no men telle hir conseil til hir wyves	That no men tell their secrets to their wives
Of swich thyng as they wolde han secree fayn,	Of such things as they would earnestly keep secret,
If that it touche hir lymes or hir lyves.	If it concerns their limbs or their lives.

Of Hercules, the supreme conqueror,	Syngen his werkes laude and heigh renoun;
His works sing his praise and high renown;	For in his tyme of strengthe he was the flour.
For in his time he was the flower of strength.	He slow and rafte the skyn of the leoun;

And he slew Cacus in a cave of stone;	He slow the geant Antheus the stronge;
He slew the giant Antheus the strong;	He slow the grisly boor, and that anon;
He slew the grisly boar, and that very quickly;	And bar the hevene on his nekke longe.
And long bore the heaven on his neck.	Was nevere wight, sith that this world bigan,
Was never a person, since this world began,	That slow so manye monstres as dide he.
That slew as many monsters as did he.	Thurghout this wyde world his name ran,
Throughout this wide world his name ran,	What for his strengthe and for his heigh bountee,
What for his strength and for his great goodness,	And every reawme wente he for to see.
And he went to see every realm.	He was so stroong that no man myghte hym lette.
He was so strong that no man could prevent him.	At bothe the worldes endes, seith Trophee,
At both ends of the world, says Trophee,	In stide of boundes he a pileer sette.
In stead of boundary markers he set a pillar.	A lemman hadde this noble champioun,

And as these clerks make mention,	She hath hym sent a sherte, fressh and gay.
She has sent him a shirt, fresh and gay.	Allas, this sherte -- allas and weylaway! --
Alas, this shirt -- alas and woe oh woe! --	Envenymed was so subtilly withalle
Was so skillfully envenomed indeed	That er that he had wered it half a day
That before he had worn it half a day	It made his flessh al from his bones falle.
It made all his flesh fall from his bones.	But nathelees somme clerkes hire excusen
But nonetheless some clerks excuse her	By oon that highte Nessus, that it maked.
By one who was called Nessus, who made it.	Be as be may, I wol hire noght accusen;
However it may be, I will not accuse her;	But on his bak this sherte he wered al naked
But on his back all naked he wore this shirt	Til that his flessh was for the venym blaked.
Until his flesh was blackened because of the venom.	And whan he saugh noon oother remedye,
And when he saw no other remedy,	In hoote coles he hath hymselven raked,
He has himself covered over in hot coals,	For with no venym deigned hym to dye.
For with no venom did he deign to die.	Thus starf this worthy, myghty Hercules.
Thus died this worthy, mighty Hercules.	Lo, who may truste on Fortune any throwe?
Lo, who can trust on Fortune for any time?	For hym that folweth al this world of prees
For he who follows (the ways of) all this dangerous world	Er he be war is ofte yleyd ful lowe.
Before he is aware is often laid very low.	Ful wys is he that kan hymselven knowe!
Very wise is he who can know himself!	Beth war, for whan that Fortune list to glose,
Be wary, for when Fortune wants to deceive,	Thanne wayteth she her man to overthrowe
Then she waits to overthrow her man	By swich a wey as he wolde leest suppose.
By such a means as he would least suppose.	Nabugodonosor

The mighty throne, the precious treasure,	The glorious ceptre, and roial magestee
The glorious scepter, and royal majesty	That hadde the kyng Nabugodonosor
That had the king Nebuchadnessar	With tonge unnethe may discryved bee.
With tongue can hardly be described.	He twyes wan Jerusalem the citee;
He twice won the city of Jerusalem;	The vessel of the temple he with hym ladde.
The vessels of the temple he took with him.	At Babiloigne was his sovereyn see,
At Babylon was his sovereign throne,	In which his glorie and his delit he hadde.
In which he had his glory and his delight.	The faireste children of the blood roial

Of Israel he had gelded indeed,	And maked ech of hem to been his thral.
And made each of them to be his slave.	Amonges othere Daniel was oon,
Among others Daniel was one,	That was the wiseste child of everychon,

For he expounded the dreams of the king,	Whereas in Chaldeye clerk ne was ther noon
Whereas in Chaldea there was no clerk	That wiste to what fyn his dremes sowned.
Who knew what his dreams meant.	This proude kyng leet maken a statue of gold,
This proud king had made a statue of gold,	Sixty cubites long and sevene in brede,
Sixty cubits long and seven in breadth,	To which ymage bothe yong and oold
To which image both young and old	Comanded he to loute, and have in drede,
Commanded he to bow down, and hold in veneration,	Or in a fourneys, ful of flambes rede,
Or in a furnace, full of red flames,	He shal be brent that wolde noght obeye.
He who would not obey shall be burned.	But nevere wolde assente to that dede
But never would assent to (do) that deed	Daniel ne his yonge felawes tweye.

This king of kings was proud and arrogant;	He wende that God, that sit in magestee,
He supposed that God, who sits in majesty,	Ne myghte hym nat bireve of his estaat.
Could not deprive him of his estate.	But sodeynly he loste his dignytee,
But suddenly he lost his high office,	And lyk a beest hym semed for to bee,
And like a beast he seemed to be,	And eet hey as an oxe, and lay theroute
And ate hay like an ox, and lay outside	In reyn; with wilde beestes walked hee
In rain; with wild beasts walked he	Til certein tyme was ycome aboute.
Until a certain number of years had passed.	And lik an egles fetheres wax his heres;
And his hair grew to be like an eagle's feathers;	His nayles lyk a briddes clawes weere;
His nails were like a bird's claws;	Til God relessed hym a certeyn yeres,
Until God released him (after) a certain (number of) years,	And yaf hym wit, and thanne with many a teere
And gave him back his wits, and then with many a tear	He thanked God, and evere his lyf in feere
He thanked God, and always in his life in fear	Was he to doon amys or moore trespace;
Was he to do amiss or again trespass;	And til that tyme he leyd was on his beere
And until that time he was laid on his bier	He knew that God was ful of myght and grace.
He knew that God was full of might and grace.	Balthasar
Belshazzar	His sone, which that highte Balthasar,
His son, who was called Belshazzar,	That heeld the regne after his fader day,
Who held the reign after his father's day,	He by his fader koude noght be war,
He by (the example of) his father could not be warned,	For proud he was of herte and of array,
For he was proud of heart and of behavior,	And eek an ydolastre was he ay.
And also he was always an idolater.	His hye estaat assured hym in pryde;
His high estate made him confident in pride;	But Fortune caste hym doun, and ther he lay,
But Fortune cast him down, and there he lay,	And sodeynly his regne gan divide.
And suddenly his reign began to break apart.	A feeste he made unto his lordes alle
A feast he made for all his lords	Upon a tyme and bad hem blithe bee;
Upon a time and bade them be happy;	And thanne his officeres gan he calle:

"Go, bring forth the vessels," said he,	"Whiche that my fader in his prosperitee
"Which my father in his flourishing time	Out of the temple of Jerusalem birafte;
Robbed out of the temple of Jerusalem;	And to oure hye goddes thanke we
And to our high gods we give thanks	Of honour that oure eldres with us lafte."
For the honor that our elders left with us."	Hys wyf, his lordes, and his concubynes
His wife, his lords, and his concubines	Ay dronken, whil hire appetites laste,
Always drank, while their appetites lasted	Out of thise noble vessels sondry wynes.
Various wines out of these noble vessels.	And on a wal this kyng his eyen caste
And on a wall this king cast his eyes	And saugh an hand, armlees, that wroot ful faste,
And saw a hand, armless, that wrote very fast,	For feere of which he quook and siked soore.
For fear of which he quaked and sighed deeply.	This hand that Balthasar so soore agaste
This hand that so deeply terrified Belshazzar	Wroot Mane, techel, phares, and namoore.
Wrote Mane, techel, phares, and no more.	In all that land magicien was noon
In all that land was no magician	That koude expoune what this lettre mente;
Who could explain what this text meant;	But Daniel expowned it anoon,
But Daniel explained it right away,	And seyde, "Kyng, God to thy fader lente
And said, "King, God to thy father lent	Glorie and honour, regne, tresour, rente;
Glory and honor, reign, treasure, income;	And he was proud and nothyng God ne dradde,
And he was proud and not at all dreaded God,	And therfore God greet wreche upon hym sente,
And therefore God sent great vengeance upon him,	And hym birafte the regne that he hadde.
And took away from him the reign that he had.	"He was out cast of mannes compaignye;
"He was cast out of man's company;	With asses was his habitacioun,
With asses was his habitation,	And eet hey as a beest in weet and drye
And ate hay as a beast in wet (weather) and dry	Til that he knew, by grace and by resoun,
Until he knew, by grace and by reason,	That God of hevene hath domynacioun
That God of heaven has domination	Over every regne and every creature;
Over every reign and every creature;	And thanne hadde God of hym compassioun,
And then had God on him compassion,	And hym restored his regne and his figure.
And to him restored his reign and his bodily form.	"Eek thou, that art his sone, art proud also,
"Also thou, who art his son, art proud also,	And knowest alle thise thynges verraily,
And knowest all these things truly,	And art rebel to God, and art his foo.
And art rebel to God, and art his foe.	Thou drank eek of his vessels boldely;
Thou drank also of his vessels boldly;	Thy wyf eek, and thy wenches, synfully
Thy wife also, and thy wenches, sinfully	Dronke of the same vessels sondry wynys;
Drank of the same vessels various wines;	And heryest false goddes cursedly;
And worship false gods cursedly;	Therefore to thee yshapen ful greet pyne ys.
Therefore to thee is ordained very great pain.	"This hand was sent from God that on the wal
"This hand was sent from God that on the wall	Wroot Mane, techel, phares, truste me;
Wrote Mane, techel, pares, trust me;	Thy regne is doon; thou weyest noght at al.
Thy reign is done; thou art of no account at all.	Dyvyded is thy regne, and it shal be
Broken up is thy kingdom, and it shall be	To Medes and to Perses yeven," quod he.
Given to Medes and to Persians," said he.	And thilke same nyght this kyng was slawe,
And that same night this king was slain,	And Darius occupieth his degree,
And Darius occupies his throne,	Thogh he therto hadde neither right ne lawe.
Though for this he had neither right nor law.	Lordynges, ensample heerby may ye take
Gentlemen, example may you take from this	How that in lordshipe is no sikernesse,
How in lordship is no security,	For whan Fortune wole a man forsake,
For when Fortune will forsake a man,	She bereth awey his regne and his richesse,
She bears away his reign and his riches,	And eek his freendes, bothe moore and lesse.
And also his friends, both high ranking and low.	For what man that hath freendes thurgh Fortune,
For whatever man who has friends because of Fortune,	Mishap wol maken hem enemys, I gesse;
Misfortune will make them enemies, I believe;	This proverbe is ful sooth and ful commune.
This proverb is very true and very common.	Cenobia
Zenobia	Cenobia, of Palymerie queene,
Zenobia, of Palmyra queen,	As writen Persiens of hir noblesse,
As Persians write of her nobility,	So worthy was in armes and so keene
So worthy was in arms and so fierce	That no wight passed hire in hardynesse,
That no person passed her in boldness,	Ne in lynage, ne in oother gentillesse.
Nor in lineage, nor in other noble traits.	Of kynges blood of Perce is she descended.
Of the blood of kings of Persia is she descended.	I seye nat that she hadde moost fairnesse,
I say not that she had most beauty,	But of hir shap she myghte nat been amended.
But of her shape she could not be improved.	From hire childhede I fynde that she fledde
From her childhood I find that she fled	Office of wommen, and to wode she wente,
Duties of women, and to the woods she went,	And many a wilde hertes blood she shedde
And many a wild hart's blood she shed	With arwes brode that she to hem sente.
With broad-headed arrows that she to them sent.	She was so swift that she anon hem hente;
She was so swift that she quickly seized them;	And whan that she was elder, she wolde kille
And when she was older, she would kill	Leouns, leopardes, and beres al torente,
Lions, leopards, and bears all torn to pieces,	And in hir armes weelde hem at hir wille.
And in her arms handled them at her will.	She dorste wilde beestes dennes seke,
She dared to seek wild beasts' dens,	And rennen in the montaignes al the nyght,
And to run in the mountains all the night,	And slepen under a bussh, and she koude eke
And to sleep under a bush, and she could also	Wrastlen, by verray force and verray myght,
Wrestle, by sheer force and sheer strength,	With any yong man, were he never so wight.
With any young man, were he never so strong.	Ther myghte no thyng in hir armes stonde.
There might no thing withstand her arms.	She kepte hir maydenhod from every wight;
She kept her maidenhead from every person;	To no man deigned hire for to be bonde.
She disdained to be bound to no man.	But atte laste hir freendes han hire maried
But at the last her friends have married her	To Odenake, a prynce of that contree,
To Odenake, a prince of that country,	Al were it so that she hem longe taried.
Although it was so that she long delayed them.	And ye shul understonde how that he
And you must understand that he	Hadde swiche fantasies as hadde she.
Had such fantasies as had she.	But natheless, whan they were knyt in-feere,
But nonetheless, when they were knit together,	They lyved in joye and in felicitee,
They lived in joy and in felicity,	For ech of hem hadde oother lief and deere,
For each of them held the other beloved and dear,	Save o thyng: that she wolde nevere assente,
Save one thing: that she would never assent,	By no wey, that he sholde by hire lye
In any way, that he should by her lie	But ones, for it was hir pleyn entente
But once, for it was her full intention	To have a child, the world to multiplye;
To have a child, the world to multiply;	And also soone as that she myghte espye
And as soon as she could see	That she was nat with childe with that dede,
That she was not with child by means of that deed,	Thanne wolde she suffre hym doon his fantasye
Then would she allow him to do his desires	Eft-soone, and nat but oones, out of drede.
Again, and only but once, no doubt.	And if she were with childe at thilke cast,
And if she were with childe at that time,	Namoore sholde he pleyen thilke game
No more should he play that same game	Til fully fourty wikes weren past;
Until fully forty weeks were past;	Thanne wolde she ones suffre hym do the same.
Then would she once allow him to do the same.	Al were this Odenake wilde or tame,
Even if this Odenake were wild or tame,	He gat namoore of hire, for thus she seyde:
He got no more of her, for thus she said:	It was to wyves lecherie and shame,
It was to wives lechery and shame,	In oother caas, if that men with hem pleyde.
In any other case, if men had sexual relations with them.	Two sones by this Odenake hadde she,
Two sons by this Odenake had she,	The whiche she kepte in vertu and lettrure.
Whom she kept in virtue and learning.	But now unto oure tale turne we.
But now unto our tale we turn.	I seye, so worshipful a creature,
I say, so worshipful a creature,	And wys therwith, and large with mesure,
And wise also, and generous in moderation,	So penyble in the werre, and curteis eke,
So assiduous in the war, and courtly also,	Ne moore labour myghte in werre endure,
Nor more labor could in war endure,	Was noon, though al this world men sholde seke.
Was none, though through all this world men should seek.	Hir riche array ne myghte nat be told,
Her rich furnishings could not be told,	As wel in vessel as in hire clothyng.
As well in utensils as in her clothing.	She was al clad in perree and in gold,
She was all clad in precious stones and in gold,	And eek she lafte noght, for noon huntyng,
And also she did not neglect, for any hunting,	To have of sondry tonges ful knowyng,
To have of various tongues full knowing,	Whan that she leyser hadde; and for to entende
When she had leisure; and to endeavor	To lerne bookes was al hire likyng,
To learn books was all her desire,	How she in vertu myghte hir lyf dispende.
How she in virtue might spend her life.	And shortly of this storie for to trete,
And shortly of this history to treat,	So doghty was hir housbonde and eek she,
So doughty was her husband and also she,	That they conquered manye regnes grete
That they conquered many great realms	In the orient, with many a fair citee
In the orient, with many a fair city	Apertenaunt unto the magestee
Belonging unto the majesty	Of Rome, and with strong hond held hem ful faste,
Of Rome, and with strong hand held them very tightly,	Ne nevere myghte hir foomen doon hem flee,
Nor never could their foemen make them flee,	Ay whil that Odenakes dayes laste.
Always while Odenake's days lasted.	Hir batailles, whoso list hem for to rede,
Their battles, whoever may wish to read them,	Agayn Sapor the kyng and othere mo,
Against Shapur the king and many others,	And how that al this proces fil in dede,
And how all this business happened in actuality,	Why she conquered and what title had therto,
Why she conquered and what legal claim she had to it,	And after, of hir meschief and hire wo,
And after, of her troubles and her woe,	How that she was biseged and ytake --
How she was besieged and taken --	Lat hym unto my maister Petrak go,
Let him unto my master Petrarch go,	That writ ynough of this, I undertake.
Who wrote at length about this, I guarantee.	Whan Odenake was deed, she myghtily
When Odenake was dead, she mightily	The regnes heeld, and with hire propre hond
Defended the country, and with her own hand	Agayn hir foos she faught so cruelly
Against her foes she fought so cruelly	That ther nas kyng ne prynce in al that lond
That there was no king nor prince in all that land	That he nas glad, if he that grace fond,
That he was not glad, if he found such grace,	That she ne wolde upon his lond werreye.
That she would not make war upon his land.	With hire they maden alliance by bond
With her they made alliance by covenant	To been in pees, and lete hire ride and pleye.
To be in peace, and let her ride about and enjoy herself.	The Emperour of Rome, Claudius
The Emperor of Rome, Claudius	Ne hym bifore, the Romayn Galien,
Nor, before him, the Roman Galien,	Ne dorste nevere been so corageus,
Dared never be so courageous	Ne noon Ermyn, ne noon Egipcien,
Nor any Armenian, nor any Egyptian,	Ne Surrien, ne noon Arabyen,
Nor Syrian, nor any Arabian,	Withinne the feeld that dorste with hire fighte,
Within the field that dared fight with her,	Lest that she wolde hem with hir handes slen,
Lest she would slay them with her hands,	Or with hir meignee putten hem to flighte.
Or with her troop put them to flight.	In kynges habit wente hir sones two,
In kings' clothing went her two sons,	As heires of hir fadres regnes alle,
As heirs of all their father's reigns,	And Hermanno and Thymalao
And Hermanno and Thymalao	Hir names were, as Persiens hem calle.
Their names were, as Persians call them.	But ay Fortune hath in hire hony galle;
But always Fortune has bitterness in her honey;	This myghty queene may no while endure.
This mighty queen can no longer endure.	Fortune out of hir regne made hire falle
Fortune out of her reign made her fall	To wrecchednesse and to mysaventure.
To wretchedness and to misfortune.	Aurelian, whan that the governaunce
Aurelian, when the governance	Of Rome cam into his handes tweye,
Of Rome came into his two hands,	He shoop upon this queene to doon vengeaunce.
He prepared to do vengeance upon this queen.	And with his legions he took his weye
And with his legions he took his way	Toward Cenobie, and shortly for to seye,
Toward Zenobia, and shortly to say,	He made hire flee, and atte laste hire hente,
He made her flee, and at the last seized her,	And fettred hire, and eek hire children tweye,
And put her in fetters, and also her two children,	And wan the land, and hoom to Rome he wente.
And won the land, and home to Rome he went.	Amonges othere thynges that he wan,
Amongst other things that he won,	Hir chaar, that was with gold wroght and perree,
Her chariot, that was wrought with gold and precious stones,	This grete Romayn, this Aurelian,
This great Roman, this Aurelian,	Hath with hym lad, for that men sholde it see.
Has with him led, so that men should see it.	Biforen his triumphe walketh shee,
Before his triumphal procession she walks,	With gilte cheynes on hire nekke hangynge.
With gilded chains hanging on her neck.	Coroned was she, as after hir degree,
Crowned was she, in accord with her rank,	And ful of perree charged hire clothynge.
And her clothing loaded full of precious stones.	Allas, Fortune! She that whilom was
Alas, Fortune! She that formerly was	Dredeful to kynges and to emperoures,
Fearsome to kings and to emperors,	Now gaureth al the peple on hire, allas!
Now all the people stare on her, alas!	And she that helmed was in starke stoures
And she who wore helmets in violent battles	And wan by force townes stronge and toures,
And won by force strong towns and towers,	Shal on hir heed now were a vitremyte;
Shall on her head now wear a woman's headdress;	And she that bar the ceptre ful of floures
And she that bore the scepter full of flowers	Shal bere a distaf, hire cost for to quyte.
Shall bear a spinning staff, to pay for her living costs.	De Petro Rege Ispannie
Concerning Pedro King of Castille	O noble, O worthy Petro, glorie of Spayne,
O noble, O worthy Pedro, glory of Spain,	Whom Fortune heeld so hye in magestee,
Whom Fortune held so high in majesty,	Wel oghten men thy pitous deeth complayne!
Well ought men complain of thy piteous death!	Out of thy land thy brother made thee flee,
Out of thy land thy brother made thee flee,	And after, at a seege, by subtiltee,
And after, at a siege, by trickery,	Thou were bitraysed and lad unto his tente,
Thou were betrayed and led unto his tent,	Where as he with his owene hand slow thee,
Where he with his own hand slew thee,	Succedynge in thy regne and in thy rente.
Succeeding to thy reign and to thy income.	The feeld of snow, with th' egle of blak therinne,
The field of snow, with the eagle of black therein,	Caught with the lymrod coloured as the gleede,
Caught by the bird-lime on a rod colored like the burning coal,	He brew this cursednesse and al this synne.
He brewed this cursedness and all this sin.	The wikked nest was werker of this nede.
The wicked nest was worker of this violent act.	Noght Charles Olyver, that took ay heede
Not Charlemagne's Oliver, who always took heed	Of trouthe and honour, but of Armorike

Brought this worthy king into such a plight.	De Petro Rege de Cipro
Concerning Pierre de Lusignan, King of Cyprus	O worthy Petro, kyng of Cipre, also,
O worthy Pierre, king of Cyprus, also,	That Alisandre wan by heigh maistrie,
Who won Alexandria by great strength,	Ful many an hethen wroghtestow ful wo,
To very many a heathen thou wroughtest great woe,	Of which thyne owene liges hadde envie,
Of which thine own lieges had envy,	And for no thyng but for thy chivalrie
And for no thing but for thy chivalry	They in thy bed han slayn thee by the morwe.
They in thy bed have slain thee in the morning.	Thus kan Fortune hir wheel governe and gye,
Thus can Fortune govern and guide her wheel,	And out of joye brynge men to sorwe.
And out of joy bring men to sorrow.	De Barnabo de Lumbardia
Concerning Bernabo Visconti of Lombardy	Off Melan grete Barnabo Viscounte,
Great Bernabo Viscounti of Milan,	God of delit and scourge of Lumbardye,
God of delight and scourge of Lombardy,	Why sholde I nat thyn infortune acounte,
Why should I not thy misfortune recount,	Sith in estaat thow cloumbe were so hye?
Since in rank thou had climbed so high?	Thy brother sone, that was thy double allye,
Thy brother's son, who was thy double kinsman,	For he thy nevew was and sone-in-lawe,
For he was thy nephew and son-in-law,	Withinne his prisoun made thee to dye --
Within his prison made thee to die --	But why ne how noot I that thou were slawe.
But why nor how thou were slain I know not.	De Hugelino Comite de Pize
[Concerning Ugolino, Earl of Pisa]	Off the Erl Hugelyn of Pyze the langour
Of the anguish of Earl Ugolino of Pisa	Ther may no tonge telle for pitee.
There can no tongue tell for pity.	But litel out of Pize stant a tour,
But a little way out of Pisa stands a tower,	In which tour in prisoun put was he,
In which tower in prison he was put,	And with hym been his litel children thre;
And with him are his three little children;	The eldest scarsly fyf yeer was of age.
The eldest was scarcely five years of age.	Allas, Fortune, it was greet crueltee
Alas, Fortune, it was great cruelty	Swiche briddes for to putte in swich a cage!
To put such birds in such a cage!	Dampned was he to dyen in that prisoun,
He was damned to die in that prison,	For Roger, which that bisshop was of Pize,
For Roger, who was bishop of Pisa,	Hadde on hym maad a fals suggestioun,
Had on him made a false accusation,	Thurgh which the peple gan upon hym rise
Through which the people did rise against him	And putten hym to prisoun in swich wise
And put him into prison in such manner	As ye han herd, and mete and drynke he hadde
As you have heard, and meat and drink he had	So smal that wel unnethe it may suffise,
So small that it just barely can suffice,	And therwithal it was ful povre and badde.
And in addition it was very poor and bad.	And on a day bifil that in that hour
And on a day befell that in that hour	Whan that his mete wont was to be broght,
When his meal was accustomed to be brought,	The gayler shette the dores of the tour.
The jailer shut the doors of the tower.	He herde it wel, but he spak right noght,
He heard it well, but he spoke absolutely nothing,	And in his herte anon ther fil a thoght
And in his heart straightway there fell a thought	That they for hunger wolde doon hym dyen.
That they for hunger would make him die.	"Allas!" quod he, "Allas, that I was wroght!"
"Alas!" said he, "Alas, that I was wrought!"	Therwith the teeris fillen from his yen.
Therewith the tears fell from his eyes.	His yonge sone, that thre yeer was of age,
His young son, who was three years of age,	Unto hym seyde, "Fader, why do ye wepe?
Unto him said, "Father, why do you weep?	Whanne wol the gayler bryngen oure potage?
When will the jailer bring our soup?	Is ther no morsel breed that ye do kepe?
Is there no morsel of bread that you do keep?	I am so hungry that I may nat slepe.
I am so hungry that I can not sleep.	Now wolde God that I myghte slepen evere!
Now would God that I might sleep forever!	Thanne sholde nat hunger in my wombe crepe;
Then hunger should not creep in my belly;	Ther is no thyng, but breed, that me were levere."
There is nothing, but food, that I would rather have."	Thus day by day this child bigan to crye,
Thus day by day this child began to cry,	Til in his fadres barm adoun it lay,
Until in his father's bosom down it lay,	And seyde, "Farewel, fader, I moot dye!"
And said, "Farewell, father, I must die!"	And kiste his fader, and dyde the same day.
And kissed his father, and died the same day.	And whan the woful fader deed it say,
And when the woeful father saw him dead,	For wo his armes two he gan to byte,
For woe his two arms he began to bite,	And seyde, "Allas, Fortune, and weylaway!
And said, "Alas, Fortune, and woe oh woe!	Thy false wheel my wo al may I wyte."
I can blame thy false wheel for all my woe."	His children wende that it for hunger was
His children supposed that it was for hunger	That he his armes gnow, and nat for wo,
That he gnawed on his arms, and not for woe,	And seyde, "Fader, do nat so, allas!
And said, "Father, do not so, alas!	But rather ete the flessh upon us two.
But rather eat the flesh upon us two.	Oure flessh thou yaf us, take oure flessh us fro,
Our flesh thou gave us, take our flesh from us,	And ete ynogh" -- right thus they to hym seyde,
And eat enough" -- right thus they to him said,	And after that, withinne a day or two,
And after that, within a day or two,	They leyde hem in his lappe adoun and deyde.
They laid themselves down in his lap and died.	Hymself, despeired, eek for hunger starf;
Himself, despaired, also for hunger died;	Thus ended is this myghty Erl of Pize.
Thus ended is this mighty Earl of Pisa.	From heigh estaat Fortune awey hym carf.
From high estate Fortune cut him away.	Of this tragedie it oghte ynough suffise;
Of this tragedy it ought enough suffice;	Whoso wol here it in a lenger wise,
Whoever wants to hear it in a longer version,	Redeth the grete poete of Ytaille
Read the great poet of Italy	That highte Dant, for he kan al devyse
Who is called Dante, for he can all narrate	Fro point to point; nat o word wol he faille.
In great detail; not one word will he lack.	Nero
Although that Nero were as vicius	Although Nero was as vicious
As any feend that lith ful lowe adoun,	As any fiend that lies very low down (in Hell),
Yet he, as telleth us Swetonius,	Yet he, as Suetonius tells us,
This wyde world hadde in subjeccioun,	Had this wide world in subjection,
Bothe est and west, [south], and septemtrioun.	Both east and west, [south], and north.
Of rubies, saphires, and of peerles white	Of rubies, sapphires, and of white pearls
Were alle his clothes brouded up and doun,	Were all his clothes embroidered from head to toe,
For he in gemmes greetly gan delite.	For he in gems greatly did delight.
Moore delicaat, moore pompous of array,	More fond of luxury, more pompous in behavior,
Moore proud was nevere emperour than he;	More proud than he was never emperor;
That ilke clooth that he hadde wered o day,	That same clothing that he had worn one day,
After that tyme he nolde it nevere see.	After that time he wanted never to see it.
Nettes of gold threed hadde he greet plentee	Nets of gold thread had he in great plenty
To fisshe in Tybre, whan hym liste pleye.	To fish in Tiber, when he wished to amuse himself.
His lustes were al lawe in his decree,	His desires were all lawful in his legal code,
For Fortune as his freend hym wolde obeye.	For Fortune as his friend would obey him.
He Rome brende for his delicasie;	He burned Rome for his pleasure;
The senatours he slow upon a day	The senators he slew upon one day
To heere how that men wolde wepe and crie;	To hear how men would weep and cry;
And slow his brother, and by his suster lay.	And slew his brother, and by his sister lay.
His mooder made he in pitous array,	His mother he put in piteous situation,
For he hire wombe slitte to biholde	For he slit her womb to behold
Where he conceyved was -- so weilaway	Where he was conceived -- so woe oh woe
That he so litel of his mooder tolde!	That he reckoned so little of his mother!
No teere out of his eyen for that sighte	No tear out of his eyes for that sight
Ne cam, but seyde, "A fair womman was she!"	Came, but he said, "A fair woman was she!"
Greet wonder is how that he koude or myghte	Great wonder is how that he could or might
Be domesman of hire dede beautee.	Be judge of her dead beauty.
The wyn to bryngen hym comanded he,	He commanded that the wine be brought to him ,
And drank anon -- noon oother wo he made.	And drank straightway -- no other mourning he made.
Whan myght is joyned unto crueltee,	When might is joined unto cruelty,
Allas, to depe wol the venym wade!	Alas, too deep will the venom go!
In yowthe a maister hadde this emperour	In youth this emperor had a master
To teche hym letterure and curteisye,	To teach him literature and courtesy,
For of moralitee he was the flour,	For of morality he was the flower,
As in his tyme, but if bookes lye;	In his time, unless books lie;
And whil this maister hadde of hym maistrye,	And while this master had of him mastery,
He maked hym so konnyng and so sowple	He made him so cunning and so humble
That longe tyme it was er tirannye	That long time it was before tyranny
Or any vice dorste on hym uncowple.	Or any vice dared unloose itself upon him.
This Seneca, of which that I devyse,	This Seneca, of whom I tell,
By cause Nero hadde of hym swich drede,	Because Nero had of him such dread,
For he fro vices wolde hym ay chastise	For he would always chastise him from vices
Discreetly, as by word and nat by dede --	Discreetly, as by word and not by deed --
"Sire," wolde he seyn, "an emperour moot nede	"Sire," would he say, "an emperor must of necessity
Be vertuous and hate tirannye --"	Be virtuous and hate tyranny --"
For which he in a bath made hym to blede	For which he in a bath made him to bleed
On bothe his armes, til he moste dye.	On both his arms, until he had to die.
This Nero hadde eek of acustumaunce	This Nero had also the custom
In youthe agayns his maister for to ryse,	In youth to rise in the presence of his master ,
Which afterward hym thoughte a greet grevaunce;	Which afterward seemed to him a greet grievance;
Therefore he made hym dyen in this wise.	Therefore he made him die in this manner.
But natheless this Seneca the wise	But nonetheless this Seneca the wise
Chees in a bath to dye in this manere	Chose in a bath to die in this manner
Rather than han another tormentise;	Rather than have another form of torment;
And thus hath Nero slayn his maister deere.	And thus has Nero slain his dear master.
Now fil it so that Fortune liste no lenger	Now it happened that Fortune no longer desired
The hye pryde of Nero to cherice,	The high pride of Nero to cherish,
For though that he were strong, yet was she strenger.	For though he may be strong, yet was she stronger.
She thoughte thus: "By God! I am to nyce	She thought thus: "By God! I am too foolish
To sette a man that is fulfild of vice	To set a man that is filled full of vice
In heigh degree, and emperour hym calle.	In high degree, and call him emperor.
By God, out of his sete I wol hym trice;	By God, out of his throne I will snatch him;
Whan he leest weneth, sonnest shal he falle."	When he least expects it, the most quickly shall he fall."
The peple roos upon hym on a nyght	The people rose upon him on one night
For his defaute, and whan he it espied,	For his wickedness, and when he espied it,
Out of his dores anon he hath hym dight	Out of his doors right away he has hastened himself
Allone, and ther he wende han been allied	Alone, and where he supposed to have been allied
He knokked faste, and ay the moore he cried	He knocked fast, and always the more he cried
The fastere shette they the dores alle.	The tighter they shut all the doors.
Tho wiste he wel, he hadde himself mysgyed,	Then he knew well, he had himself deluded,
And wente his wey; no lenger dorste he calle.	And went his way; no longer dared he call.
The peple cried and rombled up and doun,	The people cried and made a tumult up and down,
That with his erys herde he how they seyde,	That with his ears he heard how they said,
"Where is this false tiraunt, this Neroun?"	"Where is this false tyrant, this Nero?"
For fere almoost out of his wit he breyde,	For fear almost out of his wit he went,
And to his goddes pitously he preyde	And to his gods pitiably he prayed
For socour, but it myghte nat bityde.	For help, but it could not happen.
For drede of this hym thoughte that he deyde,	For dread of this it seemed to him that he died,
And ran into a gardyn hym to hyde.	And he ran into a garden to hide himself.
And in this gardyn foond he cherles tweye	And in this garden found he two churls
That seten by a fyr, greet and reed.	That sat by a fire, great and red.
And to thise cherles two he gan to preye	And to these two churls he did pray
To sleen hym and to girden of his heed,	To slay him and to strike off his head,
That to his body, whan that he were deed,	So that to his body, when he was deed,
Were no despit ydoon for his defame.	No insult was done for his ill fame.
Hymself he slow, he koude no bettre reed,	Himself he slew, he knew no better course of action,
Of which Fortune lough, and hadde a game.	About which Fortune laughed, and amused herself.
De Oloferno	Concerning Holofernes
Was nevere capitayn under a kyng	Was never captain under a king
That regnes mo putte in subjeccioun,	That put more reigns in subjection,
Ne strenger was in feeld of alle thyng,	Nor was stronger in all things concerning the field of battle,
As in his tyme, ne gretter of renoun,	In his time, nor greater of renown,
Ne moore pompous in heigh presumpcioun	Nor more arrogant in high presumption
Than Oloferne, which Fortune ay kiste	Than Holofernes, whom Fortune always kissed
So likerously, and ladde hym up and doun	So wantonly, and led him up and down
Til that his heed was of, er that he wiste.	Until his head was off, before he knew it.
Nat oonly that this world hadde hym in awe	Not only that this world had him in awe
For lesynge of richesse or libertee,	For (fear of) loss of riches or liberty,
But he made every man reneyen his lawe.	But he made every man renounce his religion.
"Nabugodonosor was god," seyde hee;	"Nebuchadnezzar was god," said he;
"Noon oother god sholde adoured bee."	"No other god should be adored."
Agayns his heeste no wight dorst trespace,	Against his command no person dared trespass,
Save in Bethulia, a strong citee,	Save in Bethulia, a strong city,
Where Eliachim a preest was of that place.	Where Eliachim (Joachim) was a priest of that place.
But taak kep of the deth of Oloferne:	But take heed of the death of Holofernes:
Amydde his hoost he dronke lay a-nyght,	Amid his host he lay drunk at night,
Withinne his tente, large as is a berne,	Within his tent, large as is a barn,
And yet, for al his pompe and al his myght,	And yet, for all his pomp and all his might,
Judith, a womman, as he lay upright	Judith, a woman, as he lay on his back
Slepynge, his heed of smoot, and from his tente	Sleeping, smote off his head, and from his tent
Ful pryvely she stal from every wight,	Very secretly she stole (away) from every person,
And with his heed unto hir toun she wente.	And with his head unto her town she went.
De Rege Antiocho illustri	[Concerning the Famous King Antiochus]
What nedeth it of kyng Anthiochus	What needs it of king Antiochus
To telle his hye roial magestee,	To tell his high royal majesty,
His hye pride, his werkes venymus?	His high pride, his venomous deeds?
For swich another was ther noon as he.	For such another was there no one like him.
Rede which that he was in Machabee,	Read who he was in Maccabees,
And rede the proude wordes that he seyde,	And read the proud words that he said,
And why he fil fro heigh prosperitee,	And why he fell from high prosperity,
And in an hill how wrecchedly he deyde.	And on a hill how wretchedly he died.
Fortune hym hadde enhaunced so in pride	Fortune had elevated him so in pride
That verraily he wende he myghte attayne	That truly he supposed he might attain
Unto the sterres upon every syde,	Unto the stars upon every side,
And in balance weyen ech montayne,	And in a scales weigh each mountain,
And alle the floodes of the see restrayne.	And all the floods of the sea restrain.
And Goddes peple hadde he moost in hate;	And God's people had he most in hate;
Hem wolde he sleen in torment and in payne,	Them he would slay in torment and in pain,
Wenynge that God ne myghte his pride abate.	Supposing that God could not reduce his pride.
And for that Nichanore and Thymothee	And because Nicanor and Timotheus
Of Jewes weren venquysshed myghtily,	By Jews were vanquished completely,
Unto the Jewes swich an hate hadde he	Unto the Jews such a hate had he
That he bad greithen his chaar ful hastily,	That he ordered his chariot prepared very hastily,
And swoor, and seyde ful despitously	And swore, and said very angrily
Unto Jerusalem he wolde eftsoone	Unto Jerusalem he would (go) immediately
To wreken his ire on it ful cruelly;	To wreak his ire on it very cruelly;
But of his purpos he was let ful soone.	But of his purpose he was prevented very soon.
God for his manace hym so soore smoot	God because of his threatening so sorely smote him
With invisible wounde, ay incurable,	With invisible wound, ever incurable,
That in his guttes carf it so and boot	That in his guts it carved so and bit
That his peynes weren importable.	That his pains were intolerable.
And certeinly the wreche was resonable,	And certainly the punishment was reasonable,
For many a mannes guttes dide he peyne.	For many a man's gut did he pain.
But from his purpos cursed and dampnable,	But from his cursed and damnable purpose,
For al his smert, he wolde hym nat restreyne,	For all his pain, he would not restrain himself,
But bad anon apparaillen his hoost;	But commanded straightway to prepare his host;
And sodeynly, er he was of it war,	And suddenly, before he was aware of it,
God daunted al his pride and al his boost.	God laid low all his pride and all his boast.
For he so soore fil out of his char	For he so sorely fell out of his throne
That it his limes and his skyn totar,	That it tore to pieces his limbs and his skin,
So that he neyther myghte go ne ryde,	So that he might neither walk nor ride,
But in a chayer men aboute hym bar,	But in a sedan chair men carried him about,
Al forbrused, bothe bak and syde.	All badly bruised, both back and side.
The wreche of God hym smoot so cruelly	The vengeance of God smote him so cruelly
That thurgh his body wikked wormes crepte,	That through his body wicked worms crept,
And therwithal he stank so horribly	And in addition to all that he stank so horribly
That noon of al his meynee that hym kepte,	That no one of all his household that served him,
Wheither so he wook or ellis slepte,	Whether he stayed awake or else slept,
Ne myghte noght the stynk of hym endure.	Could not endure the stink of him.
In this meschief he wayled and eek wepte,	In this affliction he wailed and also wept,
And knew God lord of every creature.	And acknowledged God lord of every creature.
To al his hoost and to hymself also	To all his host and to himself also
Ful wlatsom was the stynk of his careyne;	Full loathsome was the stink of his decaying body;
No man ne myghte hym bere to ne fro.	No man could bear him in any way.
And in this stynk and this horrible peyne,	And in this stink and this horrible pain,
He starf ful wrecchedly in a monteyne.	He died very wretchedly on a mountain.
Thus hath this robbour and this homycide,	Thus has this robber and this homicide,
That many a man made to wepe and pleyne,	That many a man made to weep and mourn,
Swich gerdoun as bilongeth unto pryde.	Such reward as belongs to pride.
De Alexandro	[Concerning Alexander]
The storie of Alisaundre is so commune	The history of Alexander is so commonly known
That every wight that hath discrecioun	That every person who has good judgment
Hath herd somwhat or al of his fortune.	Has heard something or all of his fortune.
This wyde world, as in conclusioun,	This wide world, in the end,
He wan by strengthe, or for his hye renoun	He won by strength, or for his high renown
They weren glad for pees unto hym sende.	They were glad to send unto him (to sue) for peace .
The pride of man and beest he leyde adoun,	The pride of man and beast he laid low,
Wherso he cam, unto the worldes ende.	Wherever he came, unto the world's end.
Comparisoun myghte nevere yet been maked	Comparison might never yet be made
Bitwixe hym and another conquerour;	Between him and another conqueror;
For al this world for drede of hym hath quaked.	For all this world for dread of him has trembled.
He was of knyghthod and of fredom flour;	He was flower of knighthood and of nobility;
Fortune hym made the heir of hire honour.	Fortune made him the heir of her honor.
Save wyn and wommen, no thing myghte aswage	Save wine and women, no thing might assuage
His hye entente in armes and labour,	His noble ambition in arms and struggles,
So was he ful of leonyn corage.	So was he full of leonine courage.
What pris were it to hym, though I yow tolde	What honor were it to him, though I you told
Of Darius, and an hundred thousand mo	Of Darius, and a hundred thousand more
Of kynges, princes, dukes, erles bolde	Of kings, princes, dukes, earls bold
Whiche he conquered, and broghte hem into wo?	Whom he conquered, and brought them into woe?
I seye, as fer as man may ryde or go,	I say, as far as man can ride or walk,
The world was his -- what sholde I moore devyse?	The world was his -- what more should I tell?
For though I write or tolde yow everemo	For though I should write or told you evermore
Of his knyghthod, it myghte nat suffise.	About his knighthood, it could not suffice.
Twelf yeer he regned, as seith Machabee.	Twelve years he reigned, as says Maccabees.
Philippes sone of Macidoyne he was,	He was the son of Philip of Macedonia,
That first was kyng in Grece the contree.	Who first was king in the country of Greece.
O worthy, gentil Alisandre, allas,	O worthy, noble Alexander, alas,
That evere sholde fallen swich a cas!	That ever should befall such a case!
Empoysoned of thyn owene folk thou weere;	Thou were poisoned by thine own folk;
Thy sys Fortune hath turned into aas,	Fortune has turned thy six [highest throw] into an ace [lowest],
And for thee ne weep she never a teere.	And for thee she wept never a tear.
Who shal me yeven teeris to compleyne	Who shall give me tears to complain
The deeth of gentillesse and of franchise,	The death of nobility and of magnanimity,
That al the world weelded in his demeyne,	Who all the world wielded in his control,
And yet hym thoughte it myghte nat suffise?	And yet it seemed to him it might not suffice?
So ful was his corage of heigh emprise.	So full was his disposition of high knightly prowess.
Allas, who shal me helpe to endite	Alas, who shall me help to indict
False Fortune, and poyson to despise,	False Fortune, and to despise poison,
The whiche two of al this wo I wyte?	The which two for all this woe I blame?

By wisedom, manhede, and by greet labour,	By wisdom, manhood, and by great labor,
From humble bed to roial magestee	From humble bed to royal majesty
Up roos he Julius, the conquerour,	Up rose this Julius, the conqueror,
That wan al th' occident by land and see,	That won all the west by land and sea,
By strengthe of hand, or elles by tretee,	By strength of hand, or else by treaty,
And unto Rome made hem tributarie;	And unto Rome made them tributary;
And sitthe of Rome the emperour was he	And afterwards of Rome the emperor was he
Til that Fortune weex his adversarie.	Until Fortune became his adversary.
O myghty Cesar, that in Thessalie	O mighty Caesar, that in Thessaly
Agayn Pompeus, fader thyn in lawe,	Against Pompey, thy father in law,
That of the orient hadde al the chivalrie	Who of the east had all the dominion by conquest
As fer as that the day bigynneth dawe,	As far as where the day begins to dawn,
Thou thurgh thy knyghthod hast hem take and slawe,	Thou through thy knighthood hast them taken and slain,
Save fewe folk that with Pompeus fledde,	Save for a few folk that fled with Pompey,
Thurgh which thou puttest al th' orient in awe.	Through which thou puttest all the east in awe.
Thanke Fortune, that so wel thee spedde!	Thank Fortune, that so well helped thee to succeed!
But now a litel while I wol biwaille	But now for a little while I will bewail
This Pompeus, this noble governour	This Pompey, this noble governor
Of Rome, which that fleigh at this bataille.	Of Rome, who fled at this battle.
I seye, oon of his men, a fals traitour,	I say, one of his men, a false traitor,

That evere hadde of his hye estaat envye,	Who ever had envy of his high estate,
Ful prively hath maad conspiracye	Full secretly has made conspiracy
Agayns this Julius in subtil wise,	Against this Julius in a cunning manner,
And caste the place in which he sholde dye	And planned the place in which he should die
With boydekyns, as I shal yow devyse.	With daggers, as I shall tell you.
This Julius to the Capitolie wente	This Julius to the Capitol went
Upon a day, as he was wont to goon,	Upon one day, as he was accustomed to go,
And in the Capitolie anon hym hente	And in the Capitol straightway seized him
This false Brutus and his othere foon,	This false Brutus and his other foes,
And stiked hym with boydekyns anoon	And stuck him with daggers straightway
With many a wounde, and thus they lete hym lye;	With many a wound, and thus they let him lie;
But nevere gronte he at no strook but oon,	But never groaned he at no stroke but one,
Or elles at two, but if his storie lye.	Or else at two, unless his history lies.
So manly was this Julius of herte,	So manly was this Julius of heart,
And so wel lovede estaatly honestee,	And so well loved dignified decency,
That though his deedly woundes soore smerte,	That though his deadly wounds sorely pained,
His mantel over his hypes caste he,	His mantle over his hips cast he,
For no man sholde seen his privetee;	So that no man should see his private parts;
And as he lay of diyng in a traunce,	And as he lay a-dying in a trance,
And wiste verraily that deed was hee,	And knew truly that he was dead,
Of honestee yet hadde he remembraunce.	Of decency yet had he remembrance.

And to Swetoun, and to Valerius also,	And to Suetonius, and to Valerius also,

Cresus	Croesus
This riche Cresus, whilom kyng of Lyde,	This rich Croesus, once king of Lydia,
Of which Cresus Cirus soore hym dradde,	Of which Croesus Cyrus was sorely afraid,
Yet was he caught amyddes al his pryde,	Yet was he caught amidst all his pride,
And to be brent men to the fyr hym ladde.	And to be burned men led him to the fire.
But swich a reyn doun fro the welkne shadde	But such a rain down from the sky poured

Of which he was so proud and eek so fayn	Of which he was so proud and also so pleased
That in vengeance he al his herte sette.	That in vengeance he set all his heart.
Upon a tree he was, as that hym thoughte,	Upon a tree he was, as it seemed to him,
Ther Juppiter hym wessh, bothe bak and syde,	Where Jupiter washed him, both back and side,
And Phebus eek a fair towaille hym broughte	And Phoebus also brought him a fair towel
To dryen hym with; and therfore wax his pryde,	To dry himself with; and therefore his pride grew,
And to his doghter, that stood hym bisyde,	And to his daughter, who stood him beside,
Which that he knew in heigh sentence habounde,	Whom he knew to abound in good judgment,
He bad hire telle hym what it signyfyde,	He bad her tell him what it signified,
And she his dreem bigan right thus expounde:	And she began right thus to expound his dream:
"The tree," quod she, "the galwes is to meene,	"The tree," said she, "is to signify the gallows,
And Juppiter bitokneth snow and reyn,	And Jupiter betokens snow and rain,
And Phebus, with his towaille so clene,	And Phoebus, with his towel so clean,
Tho been the sonne stremes for to seyn.	Those are to say the sun beams.
Thou shalt anhanged be, fader, certeyn;	Thou shalt be hanged, father, certainly;
Reyn shal thee wasshe, and sonne shal thee drye."	Rain shall thee wash, and sun shall thee dry."
Thus warned hym ful plat and ek ful pleyn	Thus warned him very bluntly and also very plainly

With unwar strook the regnes that been proude;	With unexpected stroke the reigns that are proud;
For whan men trusteth hire, thanne wol she faille,	For when men trust her, then will she fail,
And covere hire brighte face with a clowde.	And cover her bright face with a cloud.

Whil that hir housbonde was at Oseneye,	While her husband was at Oseneye,
As clerkes ben ful subtile and ful queynte;	For clerks are very subtle and very clever;
And prively he caughte hire by the queynte,	And intimately he caught her by her crotch,
And seyde, "Ywis, but if ich have my wille,	And said, "Indeed, unless I have my will,
For deerne love of thee, lemman, I spille."	For secret love of thee, sweetheart, I die."
And heeld hire harde by the haunchebones,	And held her hard by the thigh,
And seyde, "Lemman, love me al atones,	And said, "Sweetheart, love me immediately
Or I wol dyen, also God me save!"	Or I will die, so save me God!"
And she sproong as a colt dooth in the trave,	And she sprang as a colt does when restrained,
And with hir heed she wryed faste awey,	And with her head she twisted fast away,
And seyde, "I wol nat kisse thee, by my fey!	And said, "I will not kiss thee, by my faith!
Why, lat be!" quod she. "Lat be, Nicholas,	Why, let me be!" said she. "Let me be, Nicholas,
Or I wol crie `out, harrow' and `allas'!	Or I will cry `out, help' and `alas'!
Do wey youre handes, for youre curteisye!"	Take away your hands, for your courtesy!"
This Nicholas gan mercy for to crye,	This Nicholas began to cry for mercy,
And spak so faire, and profred him so faste,	And spoke so fair, and pressed his suit so fast,
That she hir love hym graunted atte laste,	That she granted him her love at the last,
And swoor hir ooth, by Seint Thomas of Kent,	And swore her oath, by Saint Thomas of Kent,
That she wol been at his comandement,	That she will be at his commandment,
Whan that she may hir leyser wel espie.	When she may well espy her opportunity.
"Myn housbonde is so ful of jalousie	"My husband is so full of jealousy
That but ye wayte wel and been privee,	That unless you wait patiently and are secretive,

"Ye moste been ful deerne, as in this cas."	"You must been very secret in this matter."
"Nay, therof care thee noght," quod Nicholas.	"No, care thee not about that," said Nicholas.
"A clerk hadde litherly biset his whyle,	"A clerk had badly wasted his time (studying),
But if he koude a carpenter bigyle."	If he could not outwit a carpenter."
And thus they been accorded and ysworn	And thus they are agreed and sworn
To wayte a tyme, as I have told biforn.	To wait for a time, as I have told before.
Whan Nicholas had doon thus everideel	When Nicholas had done thus every bit
And thakked hire aboute the lendes weel,	And well patted her about the loins,
He kiste hire sweete and taketh his sawtrie,	He kissed her sweetly and takes his psaltery,
And pleyeth faste, and maketh melodie.	And plays fast, and makes melody.
Thanne fil it thus, that to the paryssh chirche,	Then it thus happened, that to the parish church,
Cristes owene werkes for to wirche,	Christ's own works to do,
This goode wyf went on an haliday.	This good wife went on a holiday.
Hir forheed shoon as bright as any day,	Her forehead shone as bright as any day,
So was it wasshen whan she leet hir werk.	It was so washed when she left her work.
Now was ther of that chirche a parissh clerk,	Now was there of that church a parish clerk,
The which that was ycleped Absolon.	Who was called Absolon.
Crul was his heer, and as the gold it shoon,	Curly was his hair, and as the gold it shone,
And strouted as a fanne large and brode;	And stretched out like a fan large and broad;
Ful streight and evene lay his joly shode.	Very straight and even lay his elegant parted hair.
His rode was reed, his eyen greye as goos.	His complexion was ruddy, his eyes gray as a goose.
With Poules wyndow corven on his shoos,	With St. Paul's window carved on his shoes,
In hoses rede he wente fetisly.	In red hose he went elegantly.
Yclad he was ful smal and proprely	Clad he was very trimly and properly
Al in a kirtel of a lyght waget;	All in a tunic of a light blue;
Ful faire and thikke been the poyntes set.	Very fair and thick are the laces set.
And therupon he hadde a gay surplys	And over that he had a gay surplice
As whit as is the blosme upon the rys.	As white as is the blossom upon the branch.
A myrie child he was, so God me save.	A merry lad he was, so save me God.
Wel koude he laten blood, and clippe and shave,	Well could he draw blood, and cut hair and shave,
And maken a chartre of lond or acquitaunce.	And make a charter of land or a legal release.
In twenty manere koude he trippe and daunce	In twenty different ways could he trip and dance
After the scole of Oxenforde tho,	After the school of Oxford as it was then,
And with his legges casten to and fro,	And with his legs kick to and fro,
And pleyen songes on a smal rubible;	And play songs on a small fiddle,
Therto he song som tyme a loud quynyble;	To which he some times sang a loud high treble;
And as wel koude he pleye on a giterne.	And he could play as well on a guitar.
In al the toun nas brewhous ne taverne	In all the town there was no brew house nor tavern
That he ne visited with his solas,	That he did not visit with his entertainment,
Ther any gaylard tappestere was.	Where any merry barmaid was.
But sooth to seyn, he was somdeel squaymous	But to say the truth, he was somewhat squeamish
Of fartyng, and of speche daungerous.	About farting, and fastidious in his speech.
This Absolon, that jolif was and gay,	This Absolon, who was elegant and gay,
Gooth with a sencer on the haliday,	Goes with a censer on the holiday,
Sensynge the wyves of the parisshe faste;	Censing the wives of the parish eagerly;
And many a lovely look on hem he caste,	And many a lovely look he cast on them,
And namely on this carpenteris wyf.	And especially on this carpenter's wife.
To looke on hire hym thoughte a myrie lyf,	To look on her he thought a merry life,
She was so propre and sweete and likerous.	She was so attractive and sweet and flirtatious.
I dar wel seyn, if she hadde been a mous,	I dare well say, if she had been a mouse,
And he a cat, he wolde hire hente anon.	And he a cat, he would have grabbed her at once.
This parissh clerk, this joly Absolon,	This parish clerk, this elegant Absolon,
Hath in his herte swich a love-longynge	Has in his heart such a love-longing
That of no wyf took he noon offrynge;	That of no wife took he any offering;
For curteisie, he seyde, he wolde noon.	For courtesy, he said, he would have none.
The moone, whan it was nyght, ful brighte shoon,	The moon, when it was night, very brightly shone,
And Absolon his gyterne hath ytake;	And Absolon his guitar has taken;
For paramours he thoghte for to wake.	For the sake of love he intended to stay awake.
And forth he gooth, jolif and amorous,	And forth he goes, elegant and amorous,
Til he cam to the carpenteres hous	Until he came to the carpenter's house
A litel after cokkes hadde ycrowe,	A little after cocks had crowed,
And dressed hym up by a shot-wyndowe	And took his place up by a casement window
That was upon the carpenteris wal.	That was upon the carpenter's wall.
He syngeth in his voys gentil and smal,	He sings in his voice gentle and high,
"Now, deere lady, if thy wille be,	"Now, dear lady, if it be thy will,
I praye yow that ye wole rewe on me,"	I pray yow that you will have pity on me,"
Ful wel acordaunt to his gyternynge.	Very well in harmony with his guitar-playing.
This carpenter awook, and herde him synge,	This carpenter awoke, and heard him sing,
And spak unto his wyf, and seyde anon,	And spoke unto his wife, and said at once,
"What! Alison! Herestow nat Absolon,	"What! Alison! Hearest thou not Absolon,
That chaunteth thus under oure boures wal?"	That chants thus next to our bedroom's wall?"
And she answerde hir housbonde therwithal,	And she answered her husband immediately,
"Yis, God woot, John, I heere it every deel."	"Yes indeed, God knows, John, I hear it every bit."
This passeth forth; what wol ye bet than weel?	This goes on; what more would you have?
Fro day to day this joly Absolon	From day to day this elegant Absolon
So woweth hire that hym is wo bigon.	So woos her that he is in a sorry state.
He waketh al the nyght and al the day;	He stays awake all the night and all the day;
He kembeth his lokkes brode, and made hym gay;	He combs his flowing locks, and dressed himself elegantly;
He woweth hire by meenes and brocage,	He woos her by go-betweens and agents,
And swoor he wolde been hir owene page;	And swore he would be her own servant;
He syngeth, brokkynge as a nyghtyngale;	He sings, trilling like a nightingale;
He sente hire pyment, meeth, and spiced ale,	He sent her sweetened wine, mead, and spiced ale,
And wafres, pipyng hoot out of the gleede;	And wafers, piping hot out of the fire;
And, for she was of town, he profred meede;	And, because she was a townie, he offered money;
For som folk wol ben wonnen for richesse,	For some folk will be won for riches,
And somme for strokes, and somme for gentillesse.	And some by force, and some for noble character.
Somtyme, to shewe his lightnesse and maistrye,	Sometimes, to show his agility and skill,
He pleyeth Herodes upon a scaffold hye.	He plays Herod upon a high stage.
But what availleth hym as in this cas?	But what good does it do him in this case?
She loveth so this hende Nicholas	She so loves this clever Nicholas
That Absolon may blowe the bukkes horn;	That Absolon may go whistle;
He ne hadde for his labour but a scorn.	He had for his labor nothing but scorn.
And thus she maketh Absolon hire ape,	And thus she makes Absolon her fool,
And al his ernest turneth til a jape.	And turns all his earnestness into a joke.
Ful sooth is this proverbe, it is no lye,	Very true is this proverb, it is no lie,
Men seyn right thus: "Alwey the nye slye	Men say right thus: "Always the nearby sly one
Maketh the ferre leeve to be looth."	Makes the distant loved one to be disliked."
For though that Absolon be wood or wrooth,	For though Absolon be crazed or angry,
By cause that he fer was from hire sight,	Because he was far from her sight,
This nye Nicholas stood in his light.	This nearby Nicholas cast him in the shadow.
Now ber thee wel, thou hende Nicholas,	Now bear thyself well, thou clever Nicholas,
For Absolon may waille and synge "allas."	For Absolon may wail and sing "alas."
And so bifel it on a Saterday,	And so it happened on a Saturday,
This carpenter was goon til Osenay;	This carpenter was gone to Osenay;
And hende Nicholas and Alisoun	And clever Nicholas and Alisoun
Acorded been to this conclusioun,	Are agreed on this plan,
That Nicholas shal shapen hym a wyle	That Nicholas shall devise a trick
This sely jalous housbonde to bigyle;	To beguile this hapless jealous husband;
And if so be the game wente aright,	And if it so be the game went right,
She sholde slepen in his arm al nyght,	She should sleep in his arms all night,
For this was his desir and hire also.	For this was his desire and hers also.
And right anon, withouten wordes mo,	And right away, without more words,
This Nicholas no lenger wolde tarie,	This Nicholas no longer would tarry,
But dooth ful softe unto his chambre carie	But has carried very quietly unto his chamber
Bothe mete and drynke for a day or tweye,	Both food and drink for a day or two,
And to hire housbonde bad hire for to seye,	And told her to say to her husband,
If that he axed after Nicholas,	If he asked about Nicholas,
She sholde seye she nyste where he was;	She should say she knew not where he was;
Of al that day she saugh hym nat with ye;	Of all that day she saw him not with eye;
She trowed that he was in maladye,	She believed that he was ill,
For, for no cry hir mayde koude hym calle,	Because, for no shout could her maid call him,
He nolde answere for thyng that myghte falle.	He would not answer for anything that might befall.
This passeth forth al thilke Saterday,	This goes on all that same Saturday,
That Nicholas stille in his chambre lay,	That Nicholas still in his chamber lay,
And eet and sleep, or dide what hym leste,	And ate and slept, or did what he pleased,
Til Sonday, that the sonne gooth to reste.	Until Sunday, when the sun goes to rest.
This sely carpenter hath greet merveyle	This hapless carpenter has great marvel
Of Nicholas, or what thyng myghte hym eyle,	About Nicholas, or what thing might ail him,
And seyde, "I am adrad, by Seint Thomas,	And said, "I am afraid, by Saint Thomas,
It stondeth nat aright with Nicholas.	Things are not right with Nicholas.
God shilde that he deyde sodeynly!	God forbid that he should suddenly die!
This world is now ful tikel, sikerly.	This world is now very ticklish, surely.
I saugh today a cors yborn to chirche	I saw today a corpse carried to church
That now, on Monday last, I saugh hym wirche.	That just now, on last Monday, I saw him work.
"Go up," quod he unto his knave anoon,	"Go up," he said unto his servant at once,
"Clepe at his dore, or knokke with a stoon.	"Call at his door, or knock with a stone.
Looke how it is, and tel me boldely."	Look how it is, and tell me quickly."

And at the chambre dore whil that he stood,	And at the chamber door while he stood,
He cride and knokked as that he were wood,	He cried and knocked as if he were crazy,
"What, how! What do ye, maister Nicholay?	"What, hey! What do you, master Nicholay?
How may ye slepen al the longe day?"	How can you sleep all the long day?"
But al for noght; he herde nat a word.	But all for naught; he heard not a word.
An hole he foond, ful lowe upon a bord,	He found a hole, very low upon a board,
Ther as the cat was wont in for to crepe,	Where the cat was accustomed to creep in,
And at that hole he looked in ful depe,	And through that hole he looked in very carefully,
And at the laste he hadde of hym a sight.	And at the last he had a sight of him.
This Nicholas sat evere capyng upright,	This Nicholas sat ever gaping upward,
As he had kiked on the newe moone.	As if he were gazing on the new moon.
Adoun he gooth, and tolde his maister soone	Down he goes, and told his master immediately
In what array he saugh this ilke man.	In what condition he saw this same man.

And seyde, "Help us, Seinte Frydeswyde!	And said, "Help us, Saint Frideswide!
A man woot litel what hym shal bityde.	A man knows little what shall happen to him.
This man is falle, with his astromye,	This man is fallen, because of his astronomy,
In some woodnesse or in som agonye.	In some madness or in some fit.
I thoghte ay wel how that it sholde be!	I always thought well how it should be!
Men sholde nat knowe of Goddes pryvetee.	Men should not know of God's secrets.
Ye, blessed be alwey a lewed man	Yes, blessed be always an unlearned man
That noght but oonly his bileve kan!	Who knows nothing but only his belief!
So ferde another clerk with astromye;	So fared another clerk with astronomy;
He walked in the feeldes for to prye	He walked in the fields to look
Upon the sterres, what ther sholde bifalle,	Upon the stars, (to find) there what should happen,
Til he was in a marle-pit yfalle;	Until he was fallen in a fertilizer pit;
He saugh nat that. But yet, by Seint Thomas,	He did not see that. But yet, by Saint Thomas,
Me reweth soore of hende Nicholas.	I feel very sorry for clever Nicholas.
He shal be rated of his studiyng,	He shall be scolded for his studying,
If that I may, by Jhesus, hevene kyng!	If that I may, by Jesus, heaven's king!
Get me a staf, that I may underspore,	Get me a staff, that I may pry up from below,
Whil that thou, Robyn, hevest up the dore.	While thou, Robyn, lift up the door.
He shal out of his studiyng, as I gesse."	He shall (come) out of his studying, as I guess."
And to the chambre dore he gan hym dresse.	And to the chamber door he turned his attention.
His knave was a strong carl for the nones,	His servant was a strong fellow for this purpose,
And by the haspe he haaf it of atones;	And by the hasp he heaved it off at once;
Into the floor the dore fil anon.	Onto the floor the door fell straightway.
This Nicholas sat ay as stille as stoon,	This Nicholas sat ever as still as stone,
And evere caped upward into the eir.	And ever gaped upward into the air.

And hente hym by the sholdres myghtily,	And seized him by the shoulders vigorously,
And shook hym harde, and cride spitously,	And shook him hard, and cried loudly,

I crouche thee from elves and fro wightes."	I bless thee from elves and from evil creatures."
Therwith the nyght-spel seyde he anon-rightes	Therewith the night-charm he said straightway
On foure halves of the hous aboute,	On four corners of the house about,
And on the thresshfold of the dore withoute:	And on the threshold of the door outside:

Blesse this hous from every wikked wight,	Bless this house from every wicked creature,
For nyghtes verye, the white pater-noster!	For evil spirits of the nights, the white pater-noster!

Of certeyn thyng that toucheth me and thee.	About a certain matter that concerns me and thee.

This carpenter goth doun, and comth ageyn,	This carpenter goes down, and comes again,
And broghte of myghty ale a large quart;	And brought of strong ale a large quart;
And whan that ech of hem had dronke his part,	And when each of them had drunk his part,

And doun the carpenter by hym he sette.	And the carpenter sat down by him.
He seyde, "John, myn hooste, lief and deere,	He said, "John, my host, beloved and dear,
Thou shalt upon thy trouthe swere me heere	Thou shalt upon thy pledged word swear to me here
That to no wight thou shalt this conseil wreye,	That to no person thou shalt this counsel reveal,
For it is Cristes conseil that I seye,	For it is Christ's secrets that I say,
And if thou telle it man, thou art forlore;	And if thou tell it to anyone, thou art completely lost;
For this vengeaunce thou shalt han therfore,	For this vengeance thou shalt have therefore,
That if thou wreye me, thou shalt be wood."	That if thou betray me, thou shalt go mad."
"Nay, Crist forbede it, for his hooly blood!"	"Nay, Christ forbid it, for his holy blood!"
Quod tho this sely man, "I nam no labbe,	Said then this hapless man, "I am no blabbermouth,
Ne, though I seye, I nam nat lief to gabbe.	And, though I say it, I do not like to gab.
Sey what thou wolt, I shal it nevere telle	Say what thou will, I shall never tell it
To child ne wyf, by hym that harwed helle!"	To child nor wife, by Him that rescued souls from hell!"

Shal falle a reyn, and that so wilde and wood	Shall fall a rain, and that so wild and raging
That half so greet was nevere Noes flood.	That Noah's flood was never half so large.

For sorwe of this he fil almoost adoun,	For sorrow of this he almost fell down,
And seyde, "Is ther no remedie in this cas?"	And said, "Is there no remedy in this case?"
"Why, yis, for Gode," quod hende Nicholas,	"Why, yes indeed, by God," said clever Nicholas,
"If thou wolt werken after loore and reed.	"If thou will act in accordance with learning and (good) advice.
Thou mayst nat werken after thyn owene heed;	Thou mayst not act according to thine own ideas;
For thus seith Salomon, that was ful trewe:	For thus says Salomon, which was very true:
`Werk al by conseil, and thou shalt nat rewe.'	`Do all in accordance with good advice, and thou shalt not rue (it).'
And if thou werken wolt by good conseil,	And if thou will act in accordance with good advice,

Thanne peyne I me to strecche forth the nekke,	Then I take pains to stretch forth the neck,

To yeven hir pens, and namely unto me.	To give their pennies, and namely unto me.
For myn entente is nat but for to wynne,	For my intention is only to make a profit,
And nothyng for correccioun of synne.	And not at all for correction of sin.
I rekke nevere, whan that they been beryed,	I care not a bit, when they are buried,
Though that hir soules goon a-blakeberyed!	Though their souls go picking blackberries!

Thus kan I preche agayn that same vice	Thus I can preach against that same vice
Which that I use, and that is avarice.	Which I use, and that is avarice.
But though myself be gilty in that synne,	But though myself be guilty of that sin,

From avarice and soore to repente.	From avarice and bitterly to repent.

"Thanne telle I hem ensamples many oon	"Then I tell them illustrative tales many a one
Of olde stories longe tyme agoon.	Of old stories from long time ago.
For lewed peple loven tales olde;	For ignorant people love old tales;
Swiche thynges kan they wel reporte and holde.	Such things they can well repeat and hold in memory.
What, trowe ye, that whiles I may preche,	What, do you suppose, that while I can preach,
And wynne gold and silver for I teche,	And win gold and silver because I teach,
That I wol lyve in poverte wilfully?	That I will live in poverty voluntarily?
Nay, nay, I thoghte it nevere, trewely!	Nay, nay, I never thought it, truly!
For I wol preche and begge in sondry landes;	For I will preach and beg in various lands;

Or of the povereste wydwe in a village,	Or by the poorest widow in a village,
Al sholde hir children sterve for famyne.	Even though her children should die of hunger.
Nay, I wol drynke licour of the vyne	Nay, I will drink liquor of the vine
And have a joly wenche in every toun.	And have a pretty wench in every town.

That shal by reson been at youre likyng.	That shall, for good reason, be to your liking.

Heere bigynneth the Pardoners Tale.	Here begins the Pardoner's Tale.
In Flaundres whilom was a compaignye	In Flanders once was a company
Of yonge folk that haunteden folye,	Of young folk who practiced folly,
As riot, hasard, stywes, and tavernes,	Such as debauchery, gambling, brothels, and taverns,
Where as with harpes, lutes, and gyternes,	Where with harps, lutes, and guitars,
They daunce and pleyen at dees bothe day and nyght,	They dance and play at dice both day and night,
And eten also and drynken over hir myght,	And also eat and drink beyond their capacity,
Thurgh which they doon the devel sacrifise	Through which they do the devil sacrifice
Withinne that develes temple in cursed wise	Within that devil's temple in cursed manner
By superfluytee abhomynable.	By abominable excess.

That it is grisly for to heere hem swere.	That it is grisly to hear them swear.
Oure blissed Lordes body they totere --	Our blessed Lord's body they tore in pieces --

And ech of hem at otheres synne lough.	And each of them laughed at the other's sin.
And right anon thanne comen tombesteres	And right away then come dancing girls
Fetys and smale, and yonge frutesteres,	Elegantly shaped and slim, and girls selling fruits,
Syngeres with harpes, baudes, wafereres,	Singers with harps, bawds, girls selling wafers,
Whiche been the verray develes officeres	Which are the very devil's officers
To kyndle and blowe the fyr of lecherye,	To kindle and blow the fire of lechery,
That is annexed unto glotonye.	That is joined unto gluttony.
The hooly writ take I to my witnesse	The Bible I take as my witness
That luxurie is in wyn and dronkenesse.	That lechery is in wine and drunkenness.
Lo, how that dronken Looth, unkyndely,	Lo, how that drunken Lot, unnaturally,
Lay by his doghtres two, unwityngly;	Lay by his two daughters, unwittingly;
So dronke he was, he nyste what he wroghte.	So drunk he was, he knew not what he did.
Herodes, whoso wel the stories soghte,	Herod, whoever should seek well the histories (would learn),
Whan he of wyn was repleet at his feeste,	When he was filled with wine at his feast,
Right at his owene table he yaf his heeste	Right at his own table he gave his command
To sleen the Baptist John, ful giltelees.	To slay John the Baptist, full guiltless.
Senec seith a good word doutelees;	Seneca says a good word, doubtless;
He seith he kan no difference fynde	He says he can find no difference
Bitwix a man that is out of his mynde	Between a man that is out of his mind
And a man which that is dronkelewe,	And a man that is drunk,
But that woodnesse, yfallen in a shrewe,	Except that madness, fallen in an evil person,
Persevereth lenger than doth dronkenesse.	Lasts longer than does drunkenness.

Eet of the fruyt deffended on the tree,	Ate of the forbidden fruit on the tree,
Anon he was out cast to wo and peyne.	Immediately he was cast out to woe and pain.
O glotonye, on thee wel oghte us pleyne!	O gluttony, on thee well we ought to complain!

Of his diete, sittynge at his table.	Of his diet, sitting at his table.

Maketh that est and west and north and south,	Makes that east and west and north and south,
In erthe, in eir, in water, men to swynke	In earth, in air, in water, men work
To gete a glotoun deyntee mete and drynke!	To get a glutton dainty food and drink!
Of this matiere, O Paul, wel kanstow trete:	Of this matter, O Paul, well can thou treat
"Mete unto wombe, and wombe eek unto mete,	"Food unto belly, and belly also unto food,
Shal God destroyen bothe," as Paulus seith.	God shall destroy both," as Paul says.
Allas, a foul thyng is it, by my feith,	Alas, a foul thing it is, by my faith,
To seye this word, and fouler is the dede,	To say this word, and fouler is the deed,

They been enemys of Cristes croys,	They are enemies of Christ's cross,
Of whiche the ende is deeth; wombe is hir god!"	Of which the end is death; belly is their god!"

Fulfilled of dong and of corrupcioun!	Filled with dung and with corruption!
At either ende of thee foul is the soun.	At either end of thee the sound is foul.
How greet labour and cost is thee to fynde!	How great labor and cost it is to feed thee!
Thise cookes, how they stampe, and streyne, and grynde,	These cooks, how they pound, and strain, and grind,
And turnen substaunce into accident	And turn substance into outward appearance
To fulfille al thy likerous talent!	To fulfill all thy gluttonous desire!
Out of the harde bones knokke they	Out of the hard bones they knock
The mary, for they caste noght awey	The marrow, for they throw nothing away
That may go thurgh the golet softe and swoote.	That may go through the gullet softly and sweetly.

A lecherous thyng is wyn, and dronkenesse	A lecherous thing is wine, and drunkenness
Is ful of stryvyng and of wrecchednesse.	Is full of striving and of wretchedness.
O dronke man, disfigured is thy face,	O drunken man, disfigured is thy face,
Sour is thy breeth, foul artow to embrace,	Sour is thy breath, foul art thou to embrace,
And thurgh thy dronke nose semeth the soun	And through thy drunken nose the sound seems
As though thou seydest ay "Sampsoun, Sampsoun!"	As though thou said always "Sampson, Sampson!"
And yet, God woot, Sampsoun drank nevere no wyn.	And yet, God knows, Sampson never drank any wine.
Thou fallest as it were a styked swyn;	Thou fallest like a stuck pig;
Thy tonge is lost, and al thyn honeste cure,	Thy tongue is lost, and all thy care for decency,
For dronkenesse is verray sepulture	For drunkenness is truly the sepulcher
Of mannes wit and his discrecioun.	Of man's wit and his discretion.
In whom that drynke hath dominacioun	In whom drink has domination
He kan no conseil kepe; it is no drede.	He can keep no secrets; there is no doubt.

Of which ther ryseth swich fumositee	Of which there rise such bodily vapors
That whan a man hath dronken draughtes thre,	That when a man has drunk three drafts,

For pure chaastnesse of virginitee;	For pure chastity of virginity;

And grene of conscience, and of good fame	And green because of conscience and of good reputation
The soote savour, "lilie" was hir name.	The sweet smell, "lily" was her name.

And "Lia" for hire lastynge bisynesse.	And "Leah" for her constant business.

Right so men goostly in this mayden free	Just so in this maiden men spiritually

And whil the organs maden melodie,	And while the organs made melody,

"O Lord, my soule and eek my body gye	"O Lord, my soul and also my body preserve
Unwemmed, lest that I confounded be."	Immaculate, lest that I be damned."
And for his love that dyde upon a tree	And for his love who died upon the cross

Ther is a conseil, and ye wolde it heere,	There is a secret, if you want to hear it,

He wol yow loven as me, for youre clennesse,	He will love you as (he loves) me, for your chastity,
And shewen yow his joye and his brightnesse."	And show you his joy and his brightness."
Valerian, corrected as God wolde,	Valerian, corrected as God would (have it),
Answerde agayn, "If I shal trusten thee,	Answered in reply, "If I must trust thee,
Lat me that aungel se and hym biholde;	Let me see that angel and behold him;

And as Fortune wolde that it were so,	And as Fortune would that it were so,
That oon of hem cam hoom, that oother noght.	That one of them came home, that other did not.
Anon the knyght bifore the juge is broght,	At once the knight is brought before the judge,
That seyde thus, `Thou hast thy felawe slayn,	Who said thus, `Thou hast thy fellow slain,
For which I deme thee to the deeth, certayn.'	For which I condemn thee to the death, certainly.'
And to another knyght comanded he,	And to another knight commanded he,
`Go lede hym to the deeth, I charge thee.'	`Go lead him to the death, I charge thee.'
And happed, as they wente by the weye	And it happened, as they went by the way
Toward the place ther he sholde deye,	Toward the place where he should die,
The knyght cam which men wenden had be deed.	The knight came who men believed had been dead.
Thanne thoughte they it were the beste reed	Then thought they it would be the best plan
To lede hem bothe to the juge agayn.	To lead them both to the judge again.
They seiden, `Lord, the knyght ne hath nat slayn	They said, `Lord, the knight has not slain
His felawe; heere he standeth hool alyve.'	His fellow; here he stands whole and alive.'
`Ye shul be deed,' quod he, `so moot I thryve!	`You shall be dead,' said he, `as I may thrive!
That is to seyn, bothe oon, and two, and thre!'	That is to say, both one, and two, and three!'
And to the firste knyght right thus spak he,	And to the first knight right thus spoke he,
`I dampned thee; thou most algate be deed.	`I condemned thee; thou must therefore be dead.
And thou also most nedes lese thyn heed,	And thou also must of necessity lose thy head,
For thou art cause why thy felawe deyth.'	For thou art the cause why thy fellow dies.'
And to the thridde knyght right thus he seith,	And to the third knight right thus he says,
`Thou hast nat doon that I comanded thee.'	`Thou hast not done what I commanded thee.'
And thus he dide doon sleen hem alle thre.	And thus he caused them all three to be slain.
"Irous Cambises was eek dronkelewe,	"Angry Cambises was also a drunkard,
And ay delited hym to been a shrewe.	And it always delighted him to be a scoundrel.
And so bifel, a lord of his meynee	And as it happened, a lord of his household
That loved vertuous moralitee	Who loved virtuous morality
Seyde on a day bitwix hem two right thus:	Said on a day betwixt them two right thus:
"`A lord is lost, if he be vicius;	"`A lord is lost, if he be vicious;
And dronkenesse is eek a foul record	And drunkenness is also a foul reputation
Of any man, and namely in a lord.	Of any man, and especially in a lord.
Ther is ful many an eye and many an ere	There is full many an eye and many an ear
Awaityng on a lord, and he noot where.	Watching a lord, and he knows not where.
For Goddes love, drynk moore attemprely!	For God's love, drink more temperately!
Wyn maketh man to lesen wrecchedly	Wine makes man to lose wretchedly
His mynde and eek his lymes everichon.'	His mind and also his limbs every one.'
"`The revers shaltou se,' quod he, `anon,	"`The reverse shalt thou see,' said he, `right now,
And preve it by thyn owene experience,	And prove it by thy own experience,
That wyn ne dooth to folk no swich offence.	That wine does to folk no such offence.
Ther is no wyn bireveth me my myght	There is no wine that deprives me of my power
Of hand ne foot, ne of myne eyen sight.'	Of hand nor foot, nor of my eyesight.'
And for despit he drank ful muchel moore,	And for spite he drank very much more,
An hondred part, than he hadde don bifoore;	By a hundred times, than he had done before;
And right anon this irous, cursed wrecche	And right away this angry, cursed wretch
Leet this knyghtes sone bifore hym fecche,	Had this knight's son fetched before him,
Comandynge hym he sholde bifore hym stonde.	Commanding him he should before him stand.
And sodeynly he took his bowe in honde,	And suddenly he took his bow in hand,
And up the streng he pulled to his ere,	And up the string he pulled to his ear,
And with an arwe he slow the child right there.	And with an arrow he slew the child right there.
`Now wheither have I a siker hand or noon?'	`Now tell me whether I have a sure hand or not?'
Quod he; `Is al my myght and mynde agon?	Said he; `Is all my power and mind gone?
Hath wyn bireved me myn eyen sight?'	Has wine bereft me of my eyesight?'
What sholde I telle th' answere of the knyght?	Why should I tell the answer of the knight?
His sone was slayn; ther is namoore to seye.	His son was slain; there is no more to say.
Beth war, therfore, with lordes how ye pleye.	Beware, therefore, how you act with lords.
Syngeth Placebo and `I shal, if I kan,'	Sing 'I shall please' and `I shall, if I can,'
But if it be unto a povre man.	Unless it be unto a poor man.
To a povre man men sholde his vices telle,	To a poor man one should tell his vices,
But nat to a lord, thogh he sholde go to helle.	But not to a lord, though he should go to hell.

Right as me list, and ech thyng in my cure is	Right as I wish, and in my control is each thing

Allas, that evere Apius the say!	Alas, that ever Apius saw thee!
Thus hath he falsly jugged the to-day" --	For that reason he has falsely judged thee to-day" --
And tolde hire al the cas, as ye bifore	And told her the whole business, as you before
Han herd; nat nedeth for to telle it moore.	Have heard; there is no need to tell it again.
"O mercy, deere fader!" quod this mayde,	"O mercy, dear father!" said this maid,

The teeris bruste out of hir eyen two,	The tears burst out of her two eyes,
And seyde, "Goode fader, shal I dye?	And said, "Good father, must I dye?
Is ther no grace, is ther no remedye?"	Is there no grace, is there no remedy?"

"Thanne yif me leyser, fader myn," quod she,	"Then give me time, father mine," said she,
"My deeth for to compleyne a litel space;	"To lament my death for a little while;
For, pardee, Jepte yaf his doghter grace	For, truly, Jeptha gave his daughter grace
For to compleyne, er he hir slow, allas!	To lament, before he slew her, alas!
And, God it woot, no thyng was hir trespas,	And, God knows it, her trespass was nothing,
But for she ran hir fader first to see,	Except that she ran first to see her father,
To welcome hym with greet solempnitee."	To welcome him with great solemnity."

And after, whan hir swownyng is agon,	And afterwards, when her swooning is gone,
She riseth up, and to hir fader sayde,	She rises up, and to her father said,
"Blissed be God that I shal dye a mayde!	"Blessed be God that I shall die a maid!
Yif me my deeth, er that I have a shame;	Give me my death, before I have dishonor;
Dooth with youre child youre wyl, a Goddes name!"	Do with your child your will, in God's name!"
And with that word she preyed hym ful ofte	And with that word she prayed him repeatedly
That with his swerd he wolde smyte softe;	That with his sword he would smite gently;

And to the juge he gan it to presente,	And he did present it to the judge,
As he sat yet in doom in consistorie.	As he sat yet rendering judgements in court.
And whan the juge it saugh, as seith the storie,	And when the judge saw it, as says the story,

For knowen was the false iniquitee.	For the false wickedness was known.

By manere of the cherles chalangyng,	Because of the manner of the churl's claim,
That it was by the assent of Apius;	That it was by the conspiring of Apius;

For which unto this Apius they gon	For which unto this Apius they go
And caste hym in a prisoun right anon,	And cast him in a prison straightway,

That servant was unto this Apius,	Who was servant unto this Apius,
Was demed for to hange upon a tree,	Was condemned to hang upon a tree,
But that Virginius, of his pitee,	Except that Virginius, of his pity,
So preyde for hym that he was exiled;	So prayed for him (Claudius) that he was exiled;
And elles, certes, he had been bigyled.	And also, certainly, he had been tricked (by Apius).
The remenant were anhanged, moore and lesse,	The remnant were hanged, high ranking and low,
That were consentant of this cursednesse.	Who were accessories to this crime.

Beth war, for no man woot whom God wol smyte	Beware, for no man knows whom God will smite
In no degree, ne in which manere wyse;	In any rank, nor in what sort of way;

Of wikked lyf, though it so pryvee be	Because of a wicked life, though it so secret be
That no man woot therof but God and he.	That no man knows about it but God and he.
For be he lewed man, or ellis lered,	For be he ignorant man, or else learned,

Therfore I rede yow this conseil take:	Therefore I advise you to take this counsel:
Forsaketh synne, er synne yow forsake.	Abandon sin, before sin abandons you.

The wyf cam lepynge inward with a ren.	The wife cam leaping inward at a run.
She seyde, "Allas! youre hors goth to the fen	She said, "Alas! your horse goes to the fen
With wilde mares, as faste as he may go.	With wild mares, as fast as he can go.

She gropeth alwey forther with hir hond,	She gropes always further with her hand,
And foond the bed, and thoghte noght but good,	And found the bed, and thought all was well,
By cause that the cradel by it stood,	Because the cradle by it stood,
And nyste wher she was, for it was derk;	And did not know where she was, for it was dark;
But faire and wel she creep in to the clerk,	But gently she crept in to the clerk,
And lith ful stille, and wolde han caught a sleep.	And lies full still, and would have gone to sleep.
Withinne a while this John the clerk up leep,	Within a moment this John the clerk leaped up,
And on this goode wyf he leith on soore.	And on this good wife he lays on vigorously.
So myrie a fit ne hadde she nat ful yoore;	She had not had so merry an experience for a long time;
He priketh harde and depe as he were mad.	He stabs hard and deep as if he were mad.
This joly lyf han thise two clerkes lad	This jolly life have these two clerks led
Til that the thridde cok bigan to synge.	Until the third cock began to sing (an hour before dawn).
Aleyn wax wery in the dawenynge,	Aleyn grew weary at the time of dawn,

But everemo, wher so I go or ryde,	But evermore, wherever I walk or ride,

"Now, deere lemman," quod she, "go, far weel!	"Now, dear sweetheart," said she, "go, farewell!
But er thow go, o thyng I wol thee telle:	But before thou go, one thing I will tell thee:
Whan that thou wendest homward by the melle,	When thou go homeward by the mill,
Right at the entree of the dore bihynde	Right at the entry behind the door
Thou shalt a cake of half a busshel fynde	Thou shalt find a cake of half a bushel
That was ymaked of thyn owene mele,	That was made of thine own meal,
Which that I heelp my sire for to stele.	Which I helped my father to steal.
And, goode lemman, God thee save and kepe!"	And, good sweetheart, God save and keep thee!"
And with that word almoost she gan to wepe.	And with that word she almost began to weep.
Aleyn up rist, and thoughte, "Er that it dawe,	Aleyn up rises, and thought, "Before it dawns,
I wol go crepen in by my felawe,"	I will go creep in by my fellow,"
And fond the cradel with his hand anon.	And found the cradle with his hand right away.
"By God," thoughte he, "al wrang I have mysgon.	"By God," thought he, "I have gone all wrong.
Myn heed is toty of my swynk to-nyght,	My head is dizzy from my work to-night,
That makes me that I ga nat aright.	That makes me go not right.
I woot wel by the cradel I have mysgo;	I know well by the cradle I have gone wrong;
Heere lith the millere and his wyf also."	Here lies the miller and his wife also."
And forth he goth, a twenty devel way,	And forth he goes, in the name of twenty devils,
Unto the bed ther as the millere lay.	Unto the bed where the miller lay.
He wende have cropen by his felawe John,	He expected to have crept in by his fellow John,
And by the millere in he creep anon,	And in by the miller he crept right then,
And caughte hym by the nekke, and softe he spak.	And caught him by the neck, and quietly he spoke.
He seyde, "Thou John, thou swynes-heed, awak,	He said, "Thou John, thou pig's-head, awake,
For Cristes saule, and heer a noble game.	For Christ's soul, and hear a real joke.
For by that lord that called is Seint Jame,	For by that lord that is called Saint James,
As I have thries in this shorte nyght	I have three times in this short night
Swyved the milleres doghter bolt upright,	Screwed the miller's daughter flat on her back,
Whil thow hast, as a coward, been agast."	While thou hast, like a coward, been terrified."
"Ye, false harlot," quod the millere, "hast?	"Yes, false scoundrel," said the miller, "hast (thou done so)?
A, false traitour! False clerk!" quod he,	Ah, false traitor! False clerk!" said he,
"Thow shalt be deed, by Goddes dignitee!	"Thou shalt be dead, by God's worthiness!
Who dorste be so boold to disparage	Who dared be so bold to degrade
My doghter, that is come of swich lynage?"	My daughter, who is come from such noble lineage?"
And by the throte-bolle he caughte Alayn,	And by the Adam's apple he caught Alayn,
And he hente hym despitously agayn,	And he seized him angrily in turn,
And on the nose he smoot hym with his fest.	And on the nose he smote him with his fist.
Doun ran the blody streem upon his brest;	Down ran the bloody stream upon his breast;
And in the floor, with nose and mouth tobroke,	And on the floor, with nose and mouth badly broken,
They walwe as doon two pigges in a poke;	They wallow as do two pigs in a bag;
And up they goon, and doun agayn anon,	And up they go, and down again straightway,
Til that the millere sporned at a stoon,	Until the miller stumbled on a stone,
And doun he fil bakward upon his wyf,	And down he fell backward upon his wife,
That wiste no thyng of this nyce stryf;	Who knew nothing of this foolish strife;
For she was falle aslepe a lite wight	For she was fallen asleep a little bit
With John the clerk, that waked hadde al nyght,	With John the clerk, who had been awake all night,
And with the fal out of hir sleep she breyde.	And with the fall out of her sleep she started up.
"Help! hooly croys of Bromeholm," she seyde,	"Help! holy cross of Bromeholm," she said,
"In manus tuas! Lord, to thee I calle!	"In your hands! Lord, to Thee I call!
Awak, Symond! The feend is on me falle.	Awake, Symond! The fiend has fallen on me.
Myn herte is broken; help! I nam but deed!	My heart is broken; help! I am as good as dead!
Ther lyth oon upon my wombe and on myn heed.	There lies one upon my belly and one on my head.
Help, Symkyn, for the false clerkes fighte!"	Help, Symkyn, for the false clerks fight!"
This John stirte up as faste as ever he myghte,	This John started up as fast as ever he could,
And graspeth by the walles to and fro,	And grasps by the walls to and fro,
To fynde a staf; and she stirte up also,	To find a staff; and she leaped up also,
And knew the estres bet than dide this John,	And knew the interior of the house better than did this John,
And by the wal a staf she foond anon,	And by the wall a staff she found right away,
And saugh a litel shymeryng of a light,	And saw a little glimmering of a light,
For at an hole in shoon the moone bright,	For at a hole in shone the moon bright,
And by that light she saugh hem bothe two,	And by that light she saw both the two of them,
But sikerly she nyste who was who,	But surely she did not know who was who,
But as she saugh a whit thyng in hir ye.	But she saw a white thing in her eye.
And whan she gan this white thyng espye,	And when she did espy this white thing,
She wende the clerk hadde wered a volupeer,	She thought the clerk had worn a night cap,
And with the staf she drow ay neer and neer,	And with the staff she drew ever nearer and nearer,
And wende han hit this Aleyn at the fulle,	And intended to have hit this Aleyn squarely,
And smoot the millere on the pyled skulle,	And smote the miller on the bald skull,
That doun he gooth, and cride, "Harrow! I dye!"	So that down he goes, and cried, "Help! I die!"
Thise clerkes beete hym weel and lete hym lye,	These clerks beat him well and let him lie,
And greythen hem, and tooke hir hors anon,	And dress themselves, and took their horse straightway,

And at the mille yet they tooke hir cake	And at the mill yet they took their cake
Of half a busshel flour, ful wel ybake.	Of half a bushel flour, very well baked.
Thus is the proude millere wel ybete,	Thus is the proud miller well beaten,
And hath ylost the gryndynge of the whete,	And has lost the charge for grinding of the wheat,
And payed for the soper everideel	And paid for the supper every bit
Of Aleyn and of John, that bette hym weel.	Of Aleyn and of John, who beat him well.
His wyf is swyved, and his doghter als.	His wife is screwed, and his daughter also.
Lo, swich it is a millere to be fals!	Lo, this is how it is when a miller is false!
And therfore this proverbe is seyd ful sooth,	And therefore this proverb is said very truly,
"Hym thar nat wene wel that yvele dooth."	"One who does evil should not expect good."
A gylour shal hymself bigyled be.	A trickster shall himself be tricked.
And God, that sitteth heighe in magestee,	And God, that sits high in majesty,
Save al this compaignye, grete and smale!	Save al this company, high ranking and low (every one)!
Thus have I quyt the Millere in my tale.	Thus have I repaid the Miller in my tale.

"Approche neer, and looke up murily.	" Approach nearer, and look up merrily.
Now war yow, sires, and lat this man have place!	Now make way, sirs, and let this man have room!

This were a popet in an arm t' enbrace	This would be a little doll in an arm to embrace
For any womman, small and fair of face.	For any woman, small and fair of face.
He semeth elvyssh by his contenaunce,	He seems otherworldly in his behavior,
For unto no wight dooth he daliaunce.	For unto no person is he sociable:
"Sey now somwhat, syn oother folk han sayd;	"Say something now, since other folk have spoken;
Telle us a tale of myrthe, and that anon."	Tell us a tale of mirth, and that right now."
"Hooste," quod I, "ne beth nat yvele apayd,	"Host," said I, "be not displeased,

Som deyntee thyng, me thynketh by his cheere."	Some dainty thing, it seems to me from his appearance."

In bataille and in tourneyment;	In battle and in tournament;

At Poperyng, in the place.	At Popering, in that place.
His fader was a man ful free,	His father was a very noble man,
And lord he was of that contree,	And he was lord of that country,
As it was Goddes grace.	Since it was God's will.

And I yow telle in good certayn	And I tell you in true certainty

His heer, his berd was lyk saffroun,	His hair, his beard was like saffron,
That to his girdel raughte adoun;	That to his girdle reached down;
His shoon of cordewane.	His shoes of Cordovan leather.
Of Brugges were his hosen broun,	Of Bruges were his brown stockings,
His robe was of syklatoun,	His robe was of silk woven with gold,
That coste many a jane.	That cost many a half-penny.
He koude hunte at wilde deer,	He knew how to hunt for wild animals,
And ride an haukyng for river	And ride a-hawking for water-fowl
With grey goshauk on honde;	With grey gos-hawk on hand;
Therto he was a good archeer;	Moreover he was a good archer;
Of wrastlyng was ther noon his peer,	In wrestling there was no one his peer,
Ther any ram shal stonde.	Where any ram shall stand (as a prize).
Ful many a mayde, bright in bour,	Very many a maid, bright in bed-chamber,
They moorne for hym paramour,	They mourn for him passionately,
Whan hem were bet to slepe;	When it would be better for them to sleep;
But he was chaast and no lechour,	But he was chaste and no lecher,
And sweete as is the brembul flour	And sweet as is the dog rose
That bereth the rede hepe.	That bears the red hip.
And so bifel upon a day,	And it so happened upon a day,
For sothe, as I yow telle may,	In truth, as I can tell you,
Sire Thopas wolde out ride.	Sir Thopas wanted to ride out.
He worth upon his steede gray,	He mounted upon his gray steed,
And in his hand a launcegay,	And in his hand a light lance,
A long swerd by his side.	A long sword by his side.
He priketh thurgh a fair forest,	He spurs through a fair forest,
Therinne is many a wilde best,	In which is many a wild best,

And as he priketh north and est,	And as he spurs north and east,

Bitid a sory care.	Happened a grievous misfortune.
Ther spryngen herbes grete and smale,	There spring herbs large and small,
The lycorys and the cetewale,	The licorice and the zedoary,
And many a clowe-gylofre;	And many a clove-gillyflower;
And notemuge to putte in ale,	And nutmeg to put in ale,
Wheither it be moyste or stale,	Whether it be new or old,
Or for to leye in cofre.	Or to lay in a clothes press.
The briddes synge, it is no nay,	The birds sing, it can not be denied,
The sparhauk and the papejay,	The sparrow hawk and the parrot,
That joye it was to heere;	That it was joy to hear;
The thrustelcok made eek hir lay,	The male thrush made also her lay,
The wodedowve upon the spray	The wood-pigeon upon the branch
She sang ful loude and cleere.	She sang very loud and clear.
Sire Thopas fil in love-longynge,	Sir Thopas fell in a yearning for love,
Al whan he herde the thrustel synge,	As soon as he heard the thrush sing,
And pryked as he were wood.	And spurred as if he were crazy.
His faire steede in his prikynge	His fair steed in his spurring
So swatte that men myghte him wrynge;	So sweated that one could wring him;
His sydes were al blood.	His sides were all blood.
Sire Thopas eek so wery was	Sir Thopas also so weary was
For prikyng on the softe gras,	For spurring on the soft grass,
So fiers was his corage,	So fierce was his heart,
That doun he leyde him in that plas	That down he laid him in that place
To make his steede som solas,	To give his steed some rest,
And yaf hym good forage.	And gave him good dry fodder.
"O Seinte Marie, benedicite!	"O Saint Mary, bless me!

And slepe under my goore.	And sleep under my cloak.

For in this world no womman is	For in this world no woman is
Worthy to be my make	Worthy to be my mate

Alle othere wommen I forsake,	All other women I forsake,
And to an elf-queene I me take	And to an elf-queen I betake nyself,
By dale and eek by downe!"	By dale and also by hill!"
Into his sadel he clamb anon,	Into his saddle he climbed at once,
And priketh over stile and stoon	And spurs over stile and stone
An elf-queene for t' espye,	An elf-queen for to see,
Til he so longe hath riden and goon	Until he so long had ridden and walked
That he foond, in a pryve woon,	That he found, in a secret place,
The contree of Fairye	The country of Fairy
So wilde;	So wild;
For in that contree was ther noon	For in that country there was no one
That to him durste ride or goon,	Who dared ride or go on foot at him,
Neither wyf ne childe;	Neither woman nor child;
Til that ther cam a greet geaunt,	Until there came a big giant,
His name was sire Olifaunt,	His name was sir Olifaunt,
A perilous man of dede.	A perilous man of deeds.
He seyde, "Child, by Termagaunt,	He said, "Child, by Termagaunt,
But if thou prike out of myn haunt,	Unless thou spur out of my territory,
Anon I sle thy steede	At once I will slay thy steed
With mace.	With mace.

The child seyde, "Also moote I thee,	The child said, "As I may prosper,
Tomorwe wol I meete with thee,	Tomorrow will I meet with thee,
Whan I have myn armoure;	When I have my armor;
And yet I hope, par ma fay,	And yet I trust, by my faith,
That thou shalt with this launcegay	That thou shalt by means of this light lance
Abyen it ful sowre.	Very bitterly pay for it.

Shal I percen, if I may,	Shall I pierce, if I can,
Er it be fully pryme of day,	Ere it be fully prime of day ( a.m.),
For heere thow shalt be slawe."	For here thou shalt be slain."

This geant at hym stones caste	This giant threw stones at him
Out of a fel staf-slynge.	Out of a terrible staff-sling.
But faire escapeth child Thopas,	But child Thopas safely escapes,
And al it was thurgh Goddes gras,	And it was all due to God's grace,
And thurgh his fair berynge.	And due to his fair bearing.

With a geaunt with hevedes three,	With a giant with three heads,
For paramour and jolitee	For love and pleasure
Of oon that shoon ful brighte.	Of one who shone very bright.

And next his sherte an aketoun,	And next to his shirt a quilted jacket,
And over that an haubergeoun	And over that a chain-mail shirt
For percynge of his herte;	To prevent piercing of his heart;
And over that a fyn hawberk,	And over that a fine plate armor,
Was al ywroght of Jewes werk,	Which was all wrought with jewelers' work,
Ful strong it was of plate;	Very strong it was of iron plate;
And over that his cote-armour	And over that his surcoat
As whit as is a lilye flour,	As white as is a lily flour,
In which he wol debate.	In which he will dispute.
His sheeld was al of gold so reed,	His shield was all of gold so red,
And therinne was a bores heed,	And on that was a boar's head,
A charbocle bisyde;	Beside a carbuncle (red gem);
And there he swoor on ale and breed	And there he swore on ale and bread
How that the geaunt shal be deed,	How the giant shall be dead,
Bityde what bityde!	Whatever may happen!
His jambeux were of quyrboilly,	His leg guards were of hardened leather,
His swerdes shethe of yvory,	His sword's sheath of ivory,

Of roial chivalry!	Of royal chivalry!
His goode steede al he bistrood,	His good steed he mounted
And forth upon his wey he glood	And forth upon his way he glided

Upon his creest he bar a tour,	Upon his top of his helmet he bore a tower,
And therinne stiked a lilie flour --	And in that stuck a lily flower --

Of herbes fyne and goode.	On herbs fine and good.
Hymself drank water of the well,	He himself drank water of the well,

Whilom ther was dwellynge in Lumbardye	Once there was dwelling in Lombardy
A worthy knyght, that born was of Pavye,	A worthy knight, who was born in Pavia,
In which he lyved in greet prosperitee;	In which he lived in great prosperity;
And sixty yeer a wyflees man was hee,	And sixty years a wifeless man was he,
And folwed ay his bodily delyt	And followed always his bodily desire
On wommen, ther as was his appetyt,	On women, where was his appetite,
As doon thise fooles that been seculeer.	As do these fools that are secular.
And whan that he was passed sixty yeer,	And when he was passed sixty years,
Were it for hoolynesse or for dotage	Were it for holiness or for dotage
I kan nat seye, but swich a greet corage	I can not say, but such a great desire
Hadde this knyght to been a wedded man	Had this knight to be a wedded man
That day and nyght he dooth al that he kan	That day and night he does all he can

And for to lyve under that hooly boond	And to live under that holy bond
With which that first God man and womman bond.	With which God first bound man and woman.

That in this world it is a paradys."	That in this world it is a paradise."
Thus seyde this olde knyght, that was so wys.	Thus said this old knight, who was so wise.
And certeinly, as sooth as God is kyng,	And certainly, as truly as God is king,
To take a wyf it is a glorious thyng,	To take a wife it is a glorious thing,
And namely whan a man is oold and hoor;	And especially when a man is old and white-haired;
Thanne is a wyf the fruyt of his tresor.	Then is a wife the best part of his treasure.
Thanne sholde he take a yong wyf and a feir,	Then should he take a young wife and a fair,
On which he myghte engendren hym an heir,	On which he might engender himself an heir,
And lede his lyf in joye and in solas,	And lead his life in joy and in pleasure,
Where as thise bacheleris synge "allas,"	Whereas these bachelors sing "alas,"
Whan that they fynden any adversitee	When they find any adversity
In love, which nys but childyssh vanytee.	In love, which is nothing but childish vanity.
And trewely it sit wel to be so,	And truly it is fitting to be thus,

Wel may his herte in joy and blisse habounde,	Well may his heart in joy and bliss abound,
For who kan be so buxom as a wyf?	For who can be so obedient as a wife?
Who is so trewe, and eek so ententyf	Who is so true, and also so eager
To kepe hym, syk and hool, as is his make?	To care for him, sick and well, as is his mate?
For wele or wo she wole hym nat forsake;	For happiness or woe she will not forsake him;

Of whiche he Theofraste is oon of tho.	Of which that Theofrastus is one of those.

"Ne take no wyf," quod he, "for housbondrye,	"Take no wife," said he, "for managing the household,
As for to spare in houshold thy dispence.	As to economize in thy household expenditures.
A trewe servant dooth moore diligence	A true servant does more diligence
Thy good to kepe than thyn owene wyf,	To guard thy goods than thine own wife,
For she wol clayme half part al hir lyf.	For she will claim half part all her life.
And if thou be syk, so God me save,	And if thou be sick, as God may save me,
Thy verray freendes, or a trewe knave,	Thy real friends, or a true servant,
Wol kepe thee bet than she that waiteth ay	Will take care of thee better than she that waits always
After thy good and hath doon many a day.	To inherit thy goods and has done so many a day.
And if thou take a wyf unto thyn hoold	And if thou take a wife unto thy household

This sentence, and an hundred thynges worse,	This opinion, and a hundred things worse,
Writeth this man, ther God his bones corse!	Writes this man, may God his bones curse!
But take no kep of al swich vanytee;	But take no heed of all such foolishness;
Deffie Theofraste, and herke me.	Defy Theofrastus, and listen to me.
A wyf is Goddes yifte verraily;	A wife is God's gift truly;
Alle othere manere yiftes hardily,	All other sorts of gifts certainly,
As londes, rentes, pasture, or commune,	Such as lands, rents, pasture, or right to use common land,
Or moebles -- alle been yiftes of Fortune	Or personal possessions -- all are gifts of Fortune

Wel lenger than thee list, paraventure.	Well longer than thou will wish, indeed.

And doun he leyde his heed and sleep til pryme.	And down he laid his head and slept until nine.
And afterward, whan that he saugh his tyme,	And afterwards, when he saw his time,
Up ryseth Januarie; but fresshe May	Up rises January; but fresh May
Heeld hire chambre unto the fourthe day,	Held her chamber until the fourth day,
As usage is of wyves for the beste.	As is the best usage of wives.
For every labour somtyme moot han reste,	For every labor sometime must have rest,
Or elles longe may he nat endure;	Or else long can he not endure;
This is to seyn, no lyves creature,	This is to say, no living creature,
Be it of fyssh, or bryd, or beest, or man.	Be it of fish, or bird, or beast, or man.
Now wol I speke of woful Damyan,	Now will I speak of woeful Damian,
That langwissheth for love, as ye shul heere;	That languishes for love, as you shall hear;
Therfore I speke to hym in this manere:	Therefore I speak to him in this manner:
I seye, "O sely Damyan, allas!	I say, "O innocent Damian, alas!
Andswere to my demaunde, as in this cas.	Answer to my question, in this case.
How shaltow to thy lady, fresshe May,	How shalt thou to thy lady, fresh May,
Telle thy wo? She wole alwey seye nay.	Tell thy woe? She will always say nay.
Eek if thou speke, she wol thy wo biwreye.	Also if thou speak, she will thy woe reveal.
God be thyn helpe! I kan no bettre seye."	God be thy help! I can no better say."
This sike Damyan in Venus fyr	This sick Damian in Venus' fire
So brenneth that he dyeth for desyr,	So burns that he dies for desire,
For which he putte his lyf in aventure.	For which he put his life at risk.
No lenger myghte he in this wise endure,	No longer could he in this way endure,
But prively a penner gan he borwe,	But secretly a writing set he borrowed,
And in a lettre wroot he al his sorwe,	And in a letter wrote he all his sorrow,
In manere of a compleynt or a lay,	In the manner of a poetic lament or a song,
Unto his faire, fresshe lady May;	Unto his fair, fresh lady May;
And in a purs of sylk heng on his sherte	And in a purse of silk which hung on his shirt
He hath it put, and leyde it at his herte.	He has put it, and laid it at his heart.
The moone, that at noon was thilke day	The moon, that was at noon that same day
That Januarie hath wedded fresshe May	That January has wedded fresh May
In two of Tawr, was into Cancre glyden;	In two degrees of Taurus, was into Cancer glided;
So longe hath Mayus in hir chambre abyden,	So long has May in her chamber abided,
As custume is unto thise nobles alle.	As custom is unto these nobles all.
A bryde shal nat eten in the halle	A bride shall not eat in the hall
Til dayes foure, or thre dayes atte leeste,	Until four days, or three days at the least,
Ypassed been; thanne lat hire go to feeste.	Are passed; then let her go to feast.
The fourthe day compleet fro noon to noon,	The fourth day completed from noon to noon,
Whan that the heighe masse was ydoon,	When the high mass was done,
In halle sit this Januarie and May,	In hall this January and May sit,
As fressh as is the brighte someres day.	As fresh as is the bright summer's day.
And so bifel how that this goode man	And so befell that this good man
Remembred hym upon this Damyan,	Remembered this Damian,
And seyde, "Seynte Marie! how may this be,	And said, "Saint Mary! how can this be,
That Damyan entendeth nat to me?	That Damian does not attend on me?
Is he ay syk, or how may this bityde?"	Is he always sick, or how can this happen?"
His squieres, whiche that stooden ther bisyde,	His squires, who stood there beside,
Excused hym by cause of his siknesse,	Excused him because of his sickness,
Which letted hym to doon his bisynesse;	Which prevented him from doing his duties;
Noon oother cause myghte make hym tarye.	No other cause might make him tarry.
"That me forthynketh," quod this Januarie,	"I am sorry about that," said this January,
"He is a gentil squier, by my trouthe!	"He is a gentle squire, by my troth!
If that he deyde, it were harm and routhe.	If he died, it would be a harm and a pity.
He is as wys, discreet, and as secree	He is as wise, discreet, and as circumspect
As any man I woot of his degree,	As any man I know of his rank,
And therto manly, and eek servysable,	And moreover manly, and also willing to serve,
And for to been a thrifty man right able.	And to be a worthy man right able.
But after mete, as soone as evere I may,	But after dinner, as soon as ever I can,
I wol myself visite hym, and eek May,	I will myself visit him, and also May,
To doon hym al the confort that I kan."	To do him all the comfort that I can."
And for that word hym blessed every man,	And for that word every man blessed him,
That of his bountee and his gentillesse	That of his goodness and his graciousness
He wolde so conforten in siknesse	He would so comfort in sickness
His squier, for it was a gentil dede.	His squire, for it was a gentle deed.
"Dame," quod this Januarie, "taak good hede,	"My Lady," said this January, "take good heed,
At after-mete ye with youre wommen alle,	At after-dinner you with all your women,
Whan ye han been in chambre out of this halle,	When you have been in chamber out of this hall,
That alle ye go se this Damyan.	That all you go see this Damian.
Dooth hym disport -- he is a gentil man;	Cheer him up -- he is a gentle man;
And telleth hym that I wol hym visite,	And tell him that I will him visit,
Have I no thyng but rested me a lite;	When I have done nothing but rested myself a little;
And spede yow faste, for I wole abyde	And hurry yourself, for I will wait
Til that ye slepe faste by my syde."	Until you sleep fast by my side."
And with that word he gan to hym to calle	And with that word he began to him to call
A squier, that was marchal of his halle,	A squire, that was master of ceremonies of his hall,
And tolde hym certeyn thynges, what he wolde.	And told him certain things, what he wanted.
This fresshe May hath streight hir wey yholde	This fresh May has held straight her way
With alle hir wommen unto Damyan.	With all her women unto Damian.
Doun by his beddes syde sit she than,	Down by his bed's side sits she then,
Confortynge hym as goodly as she may.	Comforting him as graciously as she can.
This Damyan, whan that his tyme he say,	This Damian, when he saw his opportunity,
In secree wise his purs and eek his bille,	In a secret way his purse and also his letter,
In which that he ywriten hadde his wille,	In which he had written his desire,
Hath put into hire hand, withouten moore,	Has put into her hand, without (doing) more,
Save that he siketh wonder depe and soore,	Save that he sighs wonderfully deep and sore,
And softely to hire right thus seyde he:	And softly to her right thus said he:
"Mercy! And that ye nat discovere me,	"Mercy! And (I ask) that you not discover me,
For I am deed if that this thyng be kyd."	For I am dead if this thing be known."
This purs hath she inwith hir bosom hyd	This purse has she within her bosom hidden
And wente hire wey; ye gete namoore of me.	And went her way; you get no more from me.
But unto Januarie ycomen is she,	But unto January come is she,
That on his beddes syde sit ful softe.	Who on his bed's side sits full softly.
He taketh hire, and kisseth hire ful ofte,	He takes her, and kisses her full often,
And leyde hym doun to slepe, and that anon.	And laid him down to sleep, and that straightway.
She feyned hire as that she moste gon	She pretended that she must go
Ther as ye woot that every wight moot neede;	Where you know that every person must go by necessity;
And whan she of this bille hath taken heede,	And when she of this letter has taken heed,
She rente it al to cloutes atte laste,	She tore it all to pieces at the last,
And in the pryvee softely it caste.	And in the privy softly threw it.
Who studieth now but faire fresshe May?	Who is perplexed now but fair fresh May?
Adoun by olde Januarie she lay,	Down by old January she lay,
That sleep til that the coughe hath hym awaked.	Who slept until the cough has him awaked.
Anon he preyde hire strepen hire al naked;	Straightway he prayed her to strip herself all naked;
He wolde of hire, he seyde, han som plesaunce;	He would of her, he said, have some pleasure;
He seyde hir clothes dide hym encombraunce,	He said her clothes got in his way,
And she obeyeth, be hire lief or looth.	And she obeys, whether she wants to or not.
But lest that precious folk be with me wrooth,	But lest that prudish folk be with me wroth,
How that he wroghte, I dar nat to yow telle,	How he worked, I dare not tell to you,
Or wheither hire thoughte it paradys or helle.	Or whether she thought it paradise or hell.
But heere I lete hem werken in hir wyse	But here I let them work in their way
Til evensong rong and that they moste aryse.	Until bell for evening prayers rang and they had to arise.
Were it by destynee or by aventure,	Were it by destiny or by chance,
Were it by influence or by nature,	Were it by astronomical influence or by nature,
Or constellacion, that in swich estaat	Or configuration of the stars, that in such a state
The hevene stood that tyme fortunaat	The heaven stood that time that it fortunate
Was for to putte a bille of Venus werkes --	Was to present a petition concerning Venus' works --
For alle thyng hath tyme, as seyn thise clerkes --	For every thing has time, as say these clerks --
To any womman for to gete hire love,	To any woman to get her love,
I kan nat seye; but grete God above,	I can not say; but great God above,
That knoweth that noon act is causelees,	That knows that no act is without cause,
He deme of al, for I wole holde my pees.	May he judge of all, for I will hold my peace.
But sooth is this, how that this fresshe May	But truth is this, how this fresh May
Hath take swich impression that day	Has taken such impression that day
Of pitee of this sike Damyan	Of pity for this sick Damian
That from hire herte she ne dryve kan	That from her heart she can not drive
The remembrance for to doon hym ese.	The thought to comfort him.
"Certeyn," thoghte she, "whom that this thyng displese	"Certainly," thought she, "whomever this thing may displease
I rekke noght, for heere I hym assure	I care not, for here I him assure
To love hym best of any creature,	To love him best of any creature,
Though he namoore hadde than his sherte."	Though he had no more than his shirt."
Lo, pitee renneth soone in gentil herte!	Lo, pity runs soon in gentle heart!
Heere may ye se how excellent franchise	Here can you see what excellent generosity
In wommen is, whan they hem narwe avyse.	In women is, when they carefully deliberate a matter.
Som tyrant is, as ther be many oon	Some tyrant is, as there be many a one
That hath an herte as hard as any stoon,	Who has a heart as hard as any stone,
Which wolde han lat hym sterven in the place	Who would have let him die in the place
Wel rather than han graunted hym hire grace,	Well rather than have granted him her grace,
And hem rejoysen in hire crueel pryde,	And rejoice in her cruel pride,
And rekke nat to been an homycide.	And care not to be a homicide.
This gentil May, fulfilled of pitee,	This gentle May, filled full of pity,
Right of hire hand a lettre made she,	In her own hand a letter made she,
In which she graunteth hym hire verray grace.	In which she grants him her true grace.
Ther lakketh noght oonly but day and place	There lacks nothing but only day and place
Wher that she myghte unto his lust suffise,	Where she might satisfy his desires,
For it shal be right as he wole devyse.	For it shall be right as he will devise.
And whan she saugh hir tyme, upon a day	And when she saw her time, upon one day
To visite this Damyan gooth May,	To visit this Damian goes May,
And sotilly this lettre doun she threste	And craftily this letter down she thrust
Under his pilwe; rede it if hym leste.	Under his pillow; let him read it if he wishes.
She taketh hym by the hand and harde hym twiste	She takes him by the hand and hard him squeezes
So secrely that no wight of it wiste,	So secretly that no one knew of it,
And bad hym been al hool, and forth she wente	And bade him be all healthy, and forth she went
To Januarie, whan that he for hire sente.	To January, when he for her sent.
Up riseth Damyan the nexte morwe;	Up rises Damian the next morning;
Al passed was his siknesse and his sorwe.	All passed was his sickness and his sorrow.
He kembeth hym, he preyneth hym and pyketh,	He combs himself, he preens and neatens himself,
He dooth al that his lady lust and lyketh,	He does all that his lady desires and pleases,
And eek to Januarie he gooth as lowe	And also to January he goes as humbly
As evere dide a dogge for the bowe.	As ever did a dog trained to hunt with an archer.
He is so plesant unto every man	He is so pleasant unto every man
(For craft is al, whoso that do it kan)	(For craft is all, whoever can do it)
That every wight is fayn to speke hym good,	That every one is eager to speak good of him,
And fully in his lady grace he stood.	And fully in his lady's favor he stood.
Thus lete I Damyan aboute his nede,	Thus leave I Damian going about his business,
And in my tale forth I wol procede.	And in my tale forth I will proceed.
Somme clerkes holden that felicitee	Some clerks maintain that felicity
Stant in delit, and therfore certeyn he,	Consists of delight, and therefore certainly he,
This noble Januarie, with al his myght,	This noble January, with all his might,
In honest wyse, as longeth to a knyght,	In a respectable manner, as is suitable to a knight,
Shoop hym to lyve ful deliciously.	Arranged for himself to live full voluptuously.
His housynge, his array, as honestly	His lodging, his clothing, as suitably
To his degree was maked as a kynges.	To his degree was made as is a king's.
Amonges othere of his honeste thynges,	Amongst others of his suitable things,
He made a gardyn, walled al with stoon;	He made a garden, walled all with stone;
So fair a gardyn woot I nowher noon.	So fair a garden know I anywhere none.
For, out of doute, I verraily suppose	For, beyond doubt, I truly suppose
That he that wroot the Romance of the Rose	That he who wrote the Romance of the Rose
Ne koude of it the beautee wel devyse;	Could not the beauty of it well describe;
Ne Priapus ne myghte nat suffise,	Nor Priapus could not be adequate,
Though he be god of gardyns, for to telle	Though he be god of gardens, to tell
The beautee of the gardyn and the welle	The beauty of the garden and the well
That stood under a laurer alwey grene.	That stood under a laurel always green.
Ful ofte tyme he Pluto and his queene,	Very often he, Pluto, and his queen,
Proserpina, and al hire fayerye,	Proserpine, and all their fairies,
Disporten hem and maken melodye	Amused themselves and made melody
Aboute that welle, and daunced, as men tolde.	About that well, and danced, as men told.
This noble knyght, this Januarie the olde,	This noble knight, this January the old,
Swich deyntee hath in it to walke and pleye,	Such pleasure has in it to walk and play,
That he wol no wight suffren bere the keye	That he will no one allow to bear the key
Save he hymself; for of the smale wyket	Save he himself; for of the small gate
He baar alwey of silver a clyket,	He bore always of silver a latchkey,
With which, whan that hym leste, he it unshette.	With which, when he desired, he unlocked it.
And whan he wolde paye his wyf hir dette	And when he would pay his wife her marital debt
In somer seson, thider wolde he go,	In summer season, thither would he go,
And May his wyf, and no wight but they two;	And May his wife, and no one but those two;
And thynges whiche that were nat doon abedde,	And things which that were not done abed,
He in the gardyn parfourned hem and spedde.	He in the garden performed and accomplished them.
And in this wyse, many a murye day,	And in this way, many a merry day,
Lyved this Januarie and fresshe May.	Lived this January and fresh May.
But worldly joye may nat alwey dure	But worldly joy can not always endure
To Januarie, ne to no creature.	To January, nor to any creature.
O sodeyn hap! O thou Fortune unstable!	O sudden chance! O thou Fortune unstable!
Lyk to the scorpion so deceyvable,	Similar to the scorpion so deceitful,
That flaterest with thyn heed whan thou wolt stynge;	That flatter with thy head when thou wilt sting;
Thy tayl is deeth, thurgh thyn envenymynge.	Thy tail is death, through thy poisoning.
O brotil joye! O sweete venym queynte!	O brittle joy! O sweet venom deceitful!
O monstre, that so subtilly kanst peynte	O monster, that so subtly can disguise
Thy yiftes under hewe of stidefastnesse,	Thy gifts under appearance of steadfastness,
That thou deceyvest bothe moore and lesse!	That thou deceivest both high and low (everyone)!
Why hastow Januarie thus deceyved,	Why hast thou January thus deceived,
That haddest hym for thy fulle freend receyved?	Thou who had received him for thy closest friend ?
And now thou hast biraft hym bothe his yen,	And now thou hast deprived him of both his eyes,
For sorwe of which desireth he to dyen.	For sorrow of which he desires to die.
Allas, this noble Januarie free,	Alas, this noble generous January,
Amydde his lust and his prosperitee,	Amid his pleasure and his prosperity,
Is woxen blynd, and that al sodeynly.	Is grown blind, and that all suddenly.
He wepeth and he wayleth pitously;	He weeps and he wails pitifully;
And therwithal the fyr of jalousie,	And with all this the fire of jealousy,
Lest that his wyf sholde falle in som folye,	Lest that his wife should fall in some folly,
So brente his herte that he wolde fayn	So burned his heart that he sincerely wished
That som man bothe hire and hym had slayn.	That some man both her and him had slain.
For neither after his deeth nor in his lyf	For neither after his death nor in his life
Ne wolde he that she were love ne wyf,	Would he that she were neither lover nor wife,
But evere lyve as wydwe in clothes blake,	But ever live as widow in clothes black,
Soul as the turtle that lost hath hire make.	Solitary as the turtledove that lost has her mate.
But atte laste, after a month or tweye,	But at the last, after a month or two,
His sorwe gan aswage, sooth to seye;	His sorrow abated, truth to say;
For whan he wiste it may noon oother be,	For when he knew it can not be otherwise,
He paciently took his adversitee,	He patiently accepted his adversity,
Save, out of doute, he may nat forgoon	Except that, no doubt, he can not refrain
That he nas jalous everemoore in oon;	From being more jealous all the time;
Which jalousye it was so outrageous	Which jealousy was so excessive
That neither in halle, n' yn noon oother hous,	That neither in hall, nor in any other house,
Ne in noon oother place, neverthemo,	Nor in any other place, no longer,
He nolde suffre hire for to ryde or go,	He would suffer her to ride or walk,
But if that he had hond on hire alway;	Unless he had a hand always on her;
For which ful ofte wepeth fresshe May,	For which full often weeps fresh May,
That loveth Damyan so benyngnely	Who loves Damian so graciously
That she moot outher dyen sodeynly	That she must either die suddenly
Or elles she moot han hym as hir leste.	Or else she must have him as she wishes.
She wayteth whan hir herte wolde breste.	She expects that her heart would burst.
Upon that oother syde Damyan	Upon that other side Damian
Bicomen is the sorwefulleste man	Is become the most sorrowful man
That evere was, for neither nyght ne day	That ever was, for neither night nor day
Ne myghte he speke a word to fresshe May,	Could he speak one word to fresh May,
As to his purpos, of no swich mateere,	Regarding his purpose, of any such matter,
But if that Januarie moste it heere,	Without January's hearing it,
That hadde an hand upon hire everemo.	Who had a hand upon her always.
But nathelees, by writyng to and fro	But nevertheless, by writing to and fro
And privee signes wiste he what she mente,	And secret signs he knew what she meant,
And she knew eek the fyn of his entente.	And she knew also the aim of his plan.
O Januarie, what myghte it thee availle,	O January, what might it thee avail,
Thogh thou myghtest se as fer as shippes saille?	Though thou could see as far as ships sail?
For as good is blynd deceyved be	For it is as good to be deceived when blind
As to be deceyved whan a man may se.	As to be deceived when a man can see.
Lo, Argus, which that hadde an hondred yen,	Lo, Argus, who had a hundred eyes,
For al that evere he koude poure or pryen,	For all that ever he could peer or pry,
Yet was he blent, and, God woot, so been mo	Yet was he deceived, and, God knows, so are others
That wenen wisly that it be nat so.	That confidently suppose indeed that it is not so.
Passe over is an ese, I sey namoore.	To overlook (trouble) is an advantage, I say no more.
This fresshe May, that I spak of so yoore,	This fresh May, whom I spoke of formerly,
In warm wex hath emprented the clyket	In warm wax has made an impression of the latchkey
That Januarie bar of the smale wyket,	That January carried of the small gate,
By which into his gardyn ofte he wente;	By which into his garden often he went;
And Damyan, that knew al hire entente,	And Damian, who knew all her plan,
The cliket countrefeted pryvely.	The latchkey counterfeited secretly.
Ther nys namoore to seye, but hastily	There is no more to say, but hastily
Som wonder by this clyket shal bityde,	Some wonder by this latchkey shall betide,
Which ye shul heeren, if ye wole abyde.	Which you shall hear, if you will abide.
O noble Ovyde, ful sooth seystou, God woot,	O noble Ovid, full truth sayest thou, God knows,
What sleighte is it, thogh it be long and hoot,	What trick is it, though (finding) it be long and painful,
That Love nyl fynde it out in som manere?	That Love will not find it out in some manner?
By Piramus and Tesbee may men leere;	By Pyramus and Thisbe can one learn;
Thogh they were kept ful longe streite overal,	Though they were kept full long strictly in every way,
They been accorded, rownynge thurgh a wal,	They are agreed, whispering through a wall,
Ther no wight koude han founde out swich a sleighte.	Where no one could have found such a trick.
But now to purpos: er that dayes eighte	But now to purpose: before eight days
Were passed [of] the month of [Juyn], bifil	Were passed [of] the month of [June], it happened
That Januarie hath caught so greet a wil,	That January has caught so great a desire,
Thurgh eggyng of his wyf, hym for to pleye	Through incitement of his wife, to enjoy himself
In his gardyn, and no wight but they tweye,	In his garden, and no one (there) but those two,
That in a morwe unto his May seith he:	That in a morning unto his May says he:
"Rys up, my wyf, my love, my lady free!	"Rise up, my wife, my love, my noble lady!
The turtles voys is herd, my dowve sweete;	The turtle dove's voice is heard, my dove sweet;
The wynter is goon with alle his reynes weete.	The winter is gone with all his rains wet.
Com forth now, with thyne eyen columbyn!	Come forth now, with thy dove-like eyes!
How fairer been thy brestes than is wyn!	How fairer are thy breasts than is wine!
The gardyn is enclosed al aboute;	The garden is enclosed all about;
Com forth, my white spouse! Out of doute	Come forth, my white spouse! Beyond doubt
Thou hast me wounded in myn herte, O wyf!	Thou hast me wounded in my heart, O wife!
No spot of thee ne knew I al my lyf.	No blemish on thee knew I all my life.
Com forth, and lat us taken oure disport;	Come forth, and let us take our pleasure;
I chees thee for my wyf and my confort."	I chose thee for my wife and my comfort."
Swiche olde lewed wordes used he.	Such old ignorant words used he.
On Damyan a signe made she,	To Damian a sign made she,
That he sholde go biforn with his cliket.	That he should go before with his latchkey.
This Damyan thanne hath opened the wyket,	This Damian then has opened the gate,
And in he stirte, and that in swich manere	And in he hurried, and that in such a way
That no wight myghte it se neither yheere,	That no one could either see or hear it,
And stille he sit under a bussh anon.	And quickly he sits still under a bush.
This Januarie, as blynd as is a stoon,	This January, as blind as is a stone,
With Mayus in his hand, and no wight mo,	With May in his hand, and no one else,
Into his fresshe gardyn is ago,	Into his fresh garden has gone,
And clapte to the wyket sodeynly.	And closed the gate quickly.
"Now wyf," quod he, "heere nys but thou and I,	"Now wife," said he, "here is no one but thou and I,
That art the creature that I best love.	That art the creature that I best love.
For by that Lord that sit in hevene above,	For by that Lord that sits in heaven above,
Levere ich hadde to dyen on a knyf	I had rather die on a knife
Than thee offende, trewe deere wyf!	Than thee offend, true dear wife!
For Goddes sake, thenk how I thee chees,	For God's sake, think how I thee chose,
Noght for no coveitise, doutelees,	Not for any greed, doubtless,
But oonly for the love I had to thee.	But only for the love I had to thee.
And though that I be oold and may nat see,	And although I be old and can not see,
Beth to me trewe, and I wol telle yow why.	Be to me true, and I will tell you why.
Thre thynges, certes, shal ye wynne therby:	Three things, certainly, shall you win thereby:
First, love of Crist, and to youreself honour,	First, love of Christ, and to yourself honor,
And al myn heritage, toun and tour;	And all my heritage, town and tower;
I yeve it yow, maketh chartres as yow leste;	I give it to you, draw up deeds as you please;
This shal be doon to-morwe er sonne reste,	This shall be done to-morrow before sun goes to rest,
So wisly God my soule brynge in blisse.	As God my soul may bring in bliss.
I prey yow first, in covenant ye me kisse;	I pray you first, to seal the contract, you kiss me;
And though that I be jalous, wyte me noght.	And though that I be jealous, blame me not.
Ye been so depe enprented in my thoght	You are so deeply imprinted in my thought
That, whan that I considere youre beautee	That, when I consider your beauty
And therwithal the unlikly elde of me,	And in addition to that the unsuitable old age of me,
I may nat, certes, though I sholde dye,	I can not, certainly, though I should die,
Forbere to been out of youre compaignye	Bear to be out of your company
For verray love; this is withouten doute.	For true love; this is without doubt.
Now kys me, wyf, and lat us rome aboute."	Now kiss me, wife, and let us roam about."
This fresshe May, whan she thise wordes herde,	This fresh May, when she these words heard,
Benyngnely to Januarie answerde,	Graciously to January answered,
But first and forward she bigan to wepe.	But first of all she began to weep.
"I have," quod she, "a soule for to kepe	"I have," said she, "a soul to keep
As wel as ye, and also myn honour,	As well as you, and also my honor,
And of my wyfhod thilke tendre flour,	And of my wifehood that same tender flower,

And cause why? It sholde reported be	And the cause why? It should reported be
And toold to hire of somme of this meynee --	And told to her by some of this company --
Of whom, it nedeth nat for to declare,	By whom, it needs not to declare,
Syn wommen konnen outen swich chaffare;	Since women know how to display such wares;
And eek my wit suffiseth nat therto	And also my wit suffices not concerning this
To tellen al; wherfore my tale is do."	To tell all; therefore my tale is done."
