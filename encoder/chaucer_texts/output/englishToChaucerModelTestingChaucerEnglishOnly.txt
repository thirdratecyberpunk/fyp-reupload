Thanne conclude I thus, sith that God of hevene
"Of that water, if it be youre wil."
"Telle me the name of the privee stoon."
"Lat no man bisye hym this art for to seche,
But it be with his brother knowlechyng";
But wasten al that ye may rape and renne.
Though ye prolle ay, ye shul it nevere fynde.
Lo! swich a lucre is in this lusty game,
That in good feith I trowe that it bee
After that day; and whan that this preest shoolde
By God, they wolden han so greet envye
And nere the freendshipe that ye dide er this
And as I may deserve it unto yow,
Was nevere brid gladder agayn the day,
With thise thre teynes, whiche that we han wroght,
And in the water rombled to and fro,
As he dide er -- and al nas but a jape;
He semed freendly to hem that knewe hym noght,
Is ther any coper herinne?" seyde he.
And in the crosselet hastily it fel.
To hym anon, and his poudre caste in
And this chanon, right in the meene while,
Another day assaye in myn absence
Was this preest, whan he saugh it was so.
And fro the fir he took up his mateere,
He took the chalk and shoop it in the wise
How that oure bisynesse shal thryve and preeve.
He demed alle the coles yliche good,
Til that the coles gonne faste brenne.
This is nat couched as it oghte be;
It dulleth me whan that I of hym speke.
And therinne put was of silver lemaille
The coles for to couchen al above
And his maister shette the dore anon,
Amonges folk for evere to appeere.
In name of Crist, to wexe a philosofre.
And took thise ounces thre to the chanoun;
"Sire," quod he to the preest, "lat youre man gon
He hath bitrayed folkes many tyme;
Wherfore, to go to the conclusion,
How Cristes peple he may to meschief brynge.
Marie, therof I pray yow hertely."
And sire," quod he, "now of my pryvetee,
"What!" quod this chanoun, "sholde I be untrewe?
And took his leve, and wente forth his weye,
This false chanon cam upon a day
But in this case listen to what I shall say.
But also for many others; you know well
I will tell it here in your presence.
And speak his words in so deceitful a manner,
Explicit prima pars
But al thyng which that shineth as the gold
To bryngen oure craft al in another plite,
"Pardee," quod oon, "somwhat of oure metal
"What," quod my lord, "ther is namoore to doone;
Somme seyde it was long on the fir makyng;
And somme of hem synken into the ground --
Now he is goon, I dar seyn boldely --
And if a man wole aske hem pryvely
They wolde hem selle and spenden on this craft.
To be releeved by hym afterward.
A! Nay! Lat be; the philosophres stoon,
Yet forgat I to maken rehersaille
In lernyng of this elvysshe nyce loore,
For al the good he spendeth theraboute
The firste spirit quyksilver called is,
Cley maad with hors or mannes heer, and oille
Oure lampes brennyng bothe nyght and day,
Oure urynales and oure descensories,
And al the cost, a twenty devel waye,
Of quyksilver, yclept mercurie crude?
And salt yput in, and also papeer,
Oure termes been so clergial and so queynte.
And whan he thurgh his madnesse and folye
That slidynge science hath me maad so bare
Al that I hadde I have lost therby,
Now wolde God my wit myghte suffise
Syn he is goon, the foule feend hym quelle!
Thou sclaundrest me heere in this compaignye,
This Chanoun drough hym neer and herde al thyng
Or ten, or twelve, or manye sommes mo,
"Peter!" quod he, "God yeve it harde grace,
Syn that he is so crafty and so sly.
That that is overdoon, it wol nat preeve
It is al baudy and totore also.
He koude al clene turnen up-so-doun,
"Wel," quod oure Hoost, "I pray thee, tel me than,
He hath take on hym many a greet emprise,
Thy lord were wys, and so I may wel deme.
By cause that I wolde yow atake,
For he hadde riden moore than trot or paas;
He was of foom al flekked as a pye.
Er we hadde riden fully fyve mile,
And lat hym care, and wepe, and wrynge, and waille!
For though thyn housbonde armed be in maille,
But sharply taak on yow the governaille.
Grisildis, for in certein he shal faille.
In heigh maistrie, and elles were it scathe --
But thyng that wol nat be, lat it be stille."
If thou be ugly, be lavish in thy expenditures;
Be fierce as is a tiger yonder in India;
Follow Echo, who holds no silence,
For which I cry in the hearing of all
For which here, for the love of the Wife of Bath --
Before we were born, knew all our frailty;
Unto a mortal man, well more we ought to
As it has been in old times long ago,
And richly his daughter married he
And there she was honored as she deserved.
Until she has regained her composure.
And in her swoon so tightly holds she
Now care I never to be dead right here;
For pitiful joy, and after her swooning
Take them back, for now mayst thou not say
She fared as if she had suddenly awakened out of a sleep,
To have pity upon her womanly steadfastness.
For she has been reared in her nurture
"Griselda," said he, as if it were a joke,
That in such poor array was to be seen,
That was pertaining to the feast.
Your judgment is false, your constancy proves evil;
And fairer fruit between them should fall,
Has every chamber prepared and his hall.
Without weakening, and shall evermore;
"I have no women capable, certainly,
Not with any proud thought in her heart,
Of which the news up sprang to high ranks and low,
Discreet and without pride, ever honorable,
That neither by her words nor her face,
And get rid of her as soon as ever he could.
And in this time no word she spoke.
"The smock," said he, "that thou hast on thy back,
Let me not like a worm go by the way.
Within your chamber, dare I confidently say.
That ever in word or deed I shall repent
It was my wretched clothing, in no way fair,
Another man as husband or as mate!
For that I thank you and God, to Whom I pray
"And in this house, where you made me the lady --
"No one can always have prosperity.
My people constrain me to take
He on a certain day in the hearing of all

But seye the mayden sholde ywedded be
This markys writen hath in special
Wenden ful wel that it hadde be right so;
How that the pope, as for his peples reste,
Made hem that they hym hatede therfore.
Wille in effect, but as hir housbonde wolde.
She was ay oon in herte and in visage,
But ther been folk of swich condicion
He wolde have wend that of som subtiltee,
Hir litel sone he wolde in erthe grave
And forth he goth with drery contenance,
I wolde it doon withouten necligence;
But first siknesse, and after, wo and peyne.
Right so thenke I to serve hym pryvely.
"Now sey they thus: `Whan Walter is agon,
O nedelees was she tempted in assay!
Er she with childe was, but, as God wolde,
Were chaunged; but he nevere hire koude fynde
He sholde it take and shewe hire this mateere,
As lordes doon, whan they wol han hir wille;
Burieth this litel body in som place
I trowe that to a norice in this cas
And in hir barm this litel child she leyde
Suspect his face, suspect his word also;
But men moote nede unto hire lust obeye,
In thynges grete, and eek swich folk wel kan
Ne chaunge my corage to another place."
She seyde, "Lord, al lyth in youre plesaunce.
"And yet, God woot, this is ful looth to me;
They seyn, to hem it is greet shame and wo
In which that I have put yow, as I trowe,
To assaye a wyf whan that it is no nede,
This markys in his herte longeth so
Peple to save and every wrong t'amende.
The commune profit koude she redresse.
Thus Walter lowely -- nay, but roially --
So benigne and so digne of reverence,
And worshipful that folk ther she was bore,
Conveyed hire; and thus the day they spende
A corone on hire heed they han ydressed,
Whoso me loveth; ther is namoore to seye."
But as ye wole youreself, right so wol I.
"I seye this: be ye redy with good herte
But shortly forth this matere for to chace,
Hir tretys, which as ye shal after heere,
I wol no thyng, ye be my lord so deere;
And al that liketh me, I dar wel seyn
And to the markys she hir fader fette.
Biside the thresshfold, in an oxes stalle,
She thoghte, "I wole with othere maydens stonde,
With many a soun of sondry melodye,
Approcheth, that this weddyng sholde be,
Wol he nat wedde? Allas! Allas, the while!
Of so yong age, as wel in chiere as dede.
That child may doon to fadres reverence.
And in greet reverence and charitee
But for to speke of vertuous beautee,
Hadden hir beestes and hir herbergage,
Comaundeth for the feste to purveye,
For yet alwey the peple somwhat dredde,
For sith I shal forgoon my libertee
I hym bitake; he may doon as hym leste.
To wedde me, as soone as evere I may.
Hir meeke preyere and hir pitous cheere
Born of the gentilleste and of the meeste
In crepeth age alwey, as stille as stoon,
That for to been a wedded man yow leste;
Yet for as muche as ye, my lord so deere,
He to the markys seyde as ye shul heere:
As for to hauke and hunte on every syde.
Therwith he was, to speke as of lynage,
Me thynketh it a thyng impertinent,
Pemond and of Saluces the contree,
As Lynyan dide of philosophie,
And therfore wol I do yow obeisance,
Ne that thy tale make us nat to slepe.
This day ne herde I of youre tonge a word.
That helpeth hym to wasten and to sowke
"Wel bet is roten appul out of hoord
Al konne he pleye on gyterne or ribible.
That fairer koude caste a paire of dys
He loved bet the taverne than the shoppe.
And of a craft of vitailliers was hee.
But `sooth pley, quaad pley,' as the Flemyng seith.
And many a Jakke of Dovere hastow soold
Herde I a millere bettre yset a-werk.
"Ha! ha!" quod he, "For Cristes passion,
Thou hast ypayed wel for my vitaille.
Everich of yow dide gentilly til oother.
The sorwe of Dorigen he tolde hym als;
"Yes, certes, wel and trewely," quod he.
For sikerly my dette shal be quyt
At certeyn dayes, yeer by yeer, to paye,
Curseth the tyme that evere he was born:
And be ye siker, he was so weel apayd
Of no biheste, and heere I take my leve,
To yow, and eek I se wel youre distresse,
That bad hire holden al that she had hight,
But thus they mette, of aventure or grace,
And whan that ye han herd the tale, demeth.
"Gooth forth anon with Dorigen," he sayde,
But if ye sholde youre trouthe kepe and save.
Answerde and seyde as I shal yow devyse:
Purposynge evere that she wolde deye.
The same of noble Porcia telle I may;
That for swich cas birafte hirself hir lyf?
O Cedasus, it is ful greet pitee
Ther shal no wight defoulen, if I may."
To lyven whan she hadde lost hir name?
Than be defouled, as it thynketh me.
That loved a mayden, heet Stymphalides,
And dreynte hemselven, as the bookes telle.
Whan thritty tirauntz, ful of cursednesse,
Save oonly deeth or elles dishonour;
She wepeth, wailleth, al a day or two,
But wel I woot the rokkes been aweye."
And in myn hand youre trouthe plighten ye
Ye sle me giltelees for verray peyne.
And whan he saugh his tyme, anon-right hee,
Wher he shal han his love or fare amys,
And in whos face, and terme, and everydeel;
And his proporcioneles convenientz
That of Britaigne the rokkes were aweye,
And preyeth hym to doon his diligence
But now in Capricorn adoun he lighte,
His woful herte of penaunce hadde a lisse.
This wyde world, which that men seye is round,
Thise amorous folk somtyme moote han hir reste."
They seten stille, and no wight but they thre.
Tho saugh he knyghtes justyng in a playn;
Aurelius in his lyf saugh nevere noon.
He tolde hem al that was in hire entente.
To Orliens that he up stirte anon,
To mannes sighte, that alle the rokkes blake
Somtyme a vyne, and grapes white and rede;
"My brother shal be warisshed hastily;
Hadde prively upon his desk ylaft;
That whiles he was at Orliens in Fraunce --
Of this matere he dorste no word seyn.
But daunceth, justeth, maketh hire good cheere;
As he that was of chivalrie the flour,
Lord Phebus, se the teeris on my cheke,
No faster cours than ye thise yeres two.
Which in the signe shal be of the Leon,
Yet emperisse aboven hym is she),
Lo, lord! My lady hath my deeth ysworn
He nyste what he spak, but thus he seyde;
This is as muche to seye as it was nyght --
And with a sorweful herte he thus answerde:
Have heer my trouthe, in al that evere I kan."
But after that in pley thus seyde she:
Have mercy, sweete, or ye wol do me deye!"
So that I wiste it myghte youre herte glade,
In swich a wise as man that asketh grace;
Songes, compleintes, roundels, virelayes,
Which that ycleped was Aurelius,
As to my doom, than is the month of May.
At after-dyner gonne they to daunce,
This gardyn ful of leves and of floures;
They leden hire by ryveres and by welles,
But thilke God that made wynd to blowe
Han rokkes slayn, al be they nat in mynde,
But, Lord, thise grisly feendly rokkes blake,
And caste hir eyen dounward fro the brynke.
And often with hire freendes walketh shee
Hath sent hire lettres hoom of his welfare,
Al for to make hire leve hire hevynesse.
As doon thise noble wyves whan hem liketh.
That of Kayrrud was cleped Arveragus,
The which that lawe of love acordeth to.
To lyve in ese, suffrance hire bihight,
Ye shul it lerne, wher so ye wole or noon;
Wommen, of kynde, desiren libertee,
Sire, I wol be youre humble trewe wyf --
Agayn hir wyl, ne kithe hire jalousie,
But atte laste she, for his worthynesse,
Here bigynneth the Frankeleyns Tale
I lerned nevere rethorik, certeyn;
Thise olde gentil Britouns in hir dayes
"The leoun sit in his awayt alway
After the text of Crist, Poul, and John,
Where thou shalt knowen of oure privetee
Is this youre wyl in ernest that ye seye?"
I payde at hoom for thy correccioun."
Ne have I nat twelf pens withinne myn hoold.
To swich thyng as men wole opposen me?"
Up peyne of cursyng, looke that thou be
Or I wol sompne hire unto oure office;
Heere may ye se, myn owene deere brother,
Axe hym thyself, if thou nat trowest me;
The devel have al, bothe hors and cart and hey!"
And right at the entryng of the townes ende,
My trouthe wol I holde to my brother,
For thou shalt, by thyn owene experience,
Somtyme we feyne, and somtyme we aryse
Whan he withstandeth oure temptacioun,
Withouten hym we have no myght, certayn,
And yet ne wan I nothyng in this day.
A lowsy jogelour kan deceyve thee,
I wende ye were a yeman trewely.
"Brother," quod he, "wiltow that I thee telle?
What I may gete in conseil prively,
My lord is hard to me and daungerous,
"Now, brother," quod this somonour, "I yow preye,
This somonour, which that was as ful of jangles
I am unknowen as in this contree;
Seyde this yeman, "Wiltow fer to day?"
Rood for to somne an old wydwe, a ribibe,
Certeyn he knew of briberyes mo
Or Jakke, or Rauf, or whoso that it were
He koude somne, on peyne of Cristes curs,
Ne spareth nat, myn owene maister deere."
For thogh this Somonour wood were as an hare,
For er the bisshop caughte hem with his hook,
Of chirche reves, and of testamentz,
Oure Hoost answerde, "Pees, namoore of this!"
In compaignye we wol have no debaat.
But if it lyke to this compaignye,
No vileyns word as yet to hym spak he.
He seyde, "Syn I shal bigynne the game,
And shortly for to tellen as it was,
Whoso be rebel to my juggement
Up roos oure Hoost, and was oure aller cok,
And that he wolde been oure governour,
I wol myselven goodly with yow ryde,
To Caunterbury-ward, I mene it so,
Hoold up youre hondes, withouten moore speche."
For trewely, confort ne myrthe is noon
For by my trouthe, if that I shal nat lye,
A large man he was with eyen stepe --
Also I prey yow to foryeve it me,
Everich a word, if it be in his charge,
And after wol I telle of our viage
To wynne silver, as he ful wel koude;
Upon a day he gat hym moore moneye
Ne was ther swich another pardoner.
Dischevelee, save his cappe, he rood al bare.
This Somonour bar to hym a stif burdoun;
In daunger hadde he at his owene gise
And if he foond owher a good felawe,
Kan clepen "Watte" as wel as kan the pope.
Nor of the knobbes sittynge on his chekes.
A SOMONOUR was ther with us in that place,
In youthe he hadde lerned a good myster:
Ther nas baillif, ne hierde, nor oother hyne,
Wel koude he kepe a gerner and a bynne;
Or lyve as scarsly as hym list desire;
Now is nat that of God a ful fair grace
And yet he hadde a thombe of gold, pardee.
And therto brood, as though it were a spade.
A SOMNOUR, and a PARDONER also,
God loved he best with al his hoole herte
Hym wolde he snybben sharply for the nonys.
So that the wolf ne made it nat myscarie;
And shame it is, if a prest take keep,
In siknesse nor in meschief to visite
Benygne he was, and wonder diligent,
And on hir feet a paire of spores sharpe.
And thries hadde she been at Jerusalem;
Hir coverchiefs ful fyne weren of ground;
For gold in phisik is a cordial,
Averrois, Damascien, and Constantyn,
The cause yknowe, and of his harm the roote,
To speke of phisik and of surgerye,
His herberwe, and his moone, his lodemenage,
Aboute his nekke, under his arm adoun.
He koude rooste, and sethe, and broille, and frye,
For catel hadde they ynogh and rente,
And they were clothed alle in o lyveree
His table dormant in his halle alway
Withoute bake mete was nevere his hous,
Of his complexioun he was sangwyn.
In termes hadde he caas and doomes alle
He semed swich, his wordes weren so wise.
Of studie took he moost cure and moost heede.
For hym was levere have at his beddes heed
For sothe he was a worthy man with alle,
His bootes clasped faire and fetisly.
That rounded as a belle out of the presse.
For thogh a wydwe hadde noght a sho,
To have with sike lazars aqueyntaunce.
And certeinly he hadde a murye note:
For unto a povre ordre for to yive
Ful wel biloved and famulier was he
He was nat pale as a forpyned goost.
And for to festne his hood under his chyn,
Upon a book in cloystre alwey to poure,
This ilke Monk leet olde thynges pace,
A MONK ther was, a fair for the maistrie,
It was almoost a spanne brood, I trowe;
Kaught in a trappe, if it were deed or bledde.
Of grece, whan she dronken hadde hir draughte.
After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe,
A Cristopher on his brest of silver sheene.
Under his belt he bar ful thriftily
He koude songes make and wel endite,
And he hadde been somtyme in chyvachie
Of fustian he wered a gypon
Somtyme with the lord of Palatye
No Cristen man so ofte of his degree.
To riden out, he loved chivalrie,
But nathelees, whil I have tyme and space,
Of sondry folk, by aventure yfalle
And specially from every shires ende
Whan Zephirus eek with his sweete breeth
And Emelye hym loveth so tendrely,
Com neer, and taak youre lady by the hond."
Lat se now of youre wommanly pitee.
And looketh now, wher moost sorwe is herinne,
Of his welfare, that loved hem so weel?
Than whan his name apalled is for age,
And take it weel that we may nat eschue,
Ther helpeth noght; al goth that ilke weye.
Yet wasteth it as it lyth by the weye.
That speces of thynges and progressiouns
Thanne may men by this ordre wel discerne
In certeyn boundes, that they may nat flee.
Er any word cam fram his wise brest,
To have with certein contrees alliaunce,
I wol nat tellen eek how that they goon
Upon the left hand, with a loud shoutynge,
Ne how she swowned whan men made the fyr,
Ne how the fyr was couched first with stree,
Mapul, thorn, bech, hasel, ew, whippeltree --
Heigh labour and ful greet apparaillynge
That sprad was al with blak, and wonder hye
Ther seten folk, of whiche oon baar his sheeld,
With flotery berd and ruggy, asshy heeres,
And of the same suyte he cladde Arcite;
He wolde make a fyr in which the office
Duc Theseus, with al his bisy cure,
"Right as ther dyed nevere man," quod he,
To Troye. Allas, the pitee that was ther,
Whan that hir housbondes ben from hem ago,
Ne me ne list thilke opinions to telle
Oonly the intellect, withouten moore,
As in this world right now ne knowe I non
"I have heer with my cosyn Palamon
Allas, the deeth! Allas, myn Emelye!
And Palamon, that was his cosyn deere.
And every lacerte in his brest adoun
Swelleth the brest of Arcite, and the soore
The gree as wel of o syde as of oother,
Ne to be lad by force unto the stake
Fermacies of herbes, and eek save
Al be it that this aventure was falle,
So was the blood yronnen in his face.
And was al his chiere, as in his herte.
Been in hire wele for joye of daun Arcite.
What kan now faire Venus doon above?
That moot namoore goon agayn to fighte?
And in the rescus of this Palamoun
As Palamon to sleen his foo Arcite.
Ful ofte a day han thise Thebanes two
Ther stomblen steedes stronge, and doun gooth al,
In gooth the sharpe spore into the syde.
So evene were they chosen, for to gesse.
With baner reed is entred right anon;
Of oon and oother, after hir degree.
"God save swich a lord, that is so good
That shal ben ordeyned on either syde;
No man therfore, up peyne of los of lyf,
An heraud on a scaffold made an "Oo!"
The grete Theseus, that of his sleep awaked
The paleys ful of peple up and doun,
Nailynge the speres, and helmes bokelynge;

Though Mars shal helpe his knyght, yet nathelees

"My deere doghter Venus," quod Saturne,
Til that the pale Saturnus the colde,
Ful lowe and dym, and seyde thus, "Victorie!"
And eek the dores, clatereden ful faste,
Eterne fir I wol bifore thee fynde.
For thilke fyr that whilom brente thee,
I am yong and unkonnynge, as thow woost,
For thilke peyne and thilke hoote fir
"O stronge god, that in the regnes colde
I putte me in thy proteccioun,
But unto which of hem I may nat telle.
For she ne wiste what it signyfied,
But sodeynly she saugh a sighte queynte,
Or if my destynee be shapen so
For tho thre formes that thou hast in thee.

And dide hir thynges, as men may biholde

Up roos the sonne, and up roos Emelye
Ful pitously, with alle circumstaunces,

Of Emelye, and dye in thy servyse.
Considere al this and rewe upon my soore,
Thow gladere of the mount of Citheron,
With hooly herte and with an heigh corage,
Ne who moost felyngly speketh of love;
He festeth hem, and dooth so greet labour
Were gadered in this noble compaignye,
His berd was wel bigonne for to sprynge;
A mantelet upon his shulder hangynge,
An hundred lordes hadde he in his route,
His longe heer was kembd bihynde his bak;
And lik a grifphon looked he aboute,
Som wol ben armed on his legges weel,
Were it in Engelond or elleswhere,
As for to speke of knyghthod of hir hond,
But stynte I wole of Theseus a lite,
A womman travaillynge was hire biforn;
Ther saugh I many another wonder storie,
I mene nat the goddesse Diane,
To telle yow al the descripsioun.
And over his heed ther shynen two figures
Al be that thilke tyme they were unborn,
Under the wheel ful lowe he lay adoun.
The careyne in the busk, with throte ycorve;
Contek, with blody knyf and sharp manace.
Every pyler, the temple to sustene,
Wroght al of burned steel, of which the entree
In thilke colde, frosty regioun
Biforn hire stood hir sone Cupido;
Suffiseth heere ensamples oon or two,
Ne yet the grete strengthe of Ercules --
Of love, which that I rekned and rekne shal,
That loves servantz in this lyf enduren;
Hath Theseus doon wroght in noble wyse.
He estward hath, upon the gate above,
Estward ther stood a gate of marbul whit,
Of Theseus, that gooth so bisily
The joye that is maked in the place
And God so wisly on my soule rewe
Al redy to darreyne hire by bataille.
As hym is shape, and herkneth in what wyse;
I speke as for my suster Emelye,
Ne make werre upon me nyght ne day,
I woot it by myself ful yore agon,
Hir wages and hir fees for hir servyse!
And myghte han lyved in Thebes roially,
He gan to looken up with eyen lighte
And softe unto hymself he seyde, "Fy
He hath considered shortly, in a clause,
For gentil men they were of greet estaat,
And seyde, "This is a short conclusioun.
I make pleynly my confessioun
Or sle hym first, for though thow knowest it lite,
As it were in a lystes roially."
But what they were, no thyng he ne woot.
And over a brook, and so forth on his weye.
Cleer was the day, as I have toold er this,
This mene I now by myghty Theseus,
The destinee, ministre general,
And after that, with sharpe speres stronge
And thynketh, "Heere cometh my mortal enemy!
And on his hors, allone as he was born,
O Cupide, out of alle charitee!
And bryngen harneys right ynough for thee;
That thou ne sholdest dyen of myn hond.
I drede noght that outher thow shalt dye,
And art my blood, and to my conseil sworn,
A longe tyme, and after he up sterte.
And over al this, to sleen me outrely
That he that is my mortal enemy,
How longe, Juno, thurgh thy crueltee,
Now up, now doun, as boket in a welle.
It is ful fair a man to bere hym evene,
And from his courser, with a lusty herte,
Is riden into the feeldes hym to pleye,
And firy Phebus riseth up so bright
To Thebes-ward, his freendes for to preye
That al that nyght, thogh that men wolde him shake,
The thridde nyght (as olde bookes seyn,
Forpyned, what for wo and for distresse.
From yeer to yeer, ful pryvely his rente;
They seyden that it were a charitee
For he was yong and myghty for the nones,
To Atthenes is he goon the nexte way.
That, sith his face was so disfigured
And with that word Arcite wook and sterte.
At Thebes, in his contree, as I seyde,
Nat oonly lik the loveris maladye
His eyen holwe and grisly to biholde,
Now demeth as yow liste, ye that kan,
In cheynes and in fettres to been deed;
For jalousie and fere of hym Arcite."
The answere of this lete I to dyvynys,
"What governance is in this prescience,
Thanne seyde he, "O crueel goddes that governe
And art a lord, greet is thyn avauntage
Thow walkest now in Thebes at thy large,
Syn that I may nat seen you, Emelye,
But he noot which the righte wey is thider,
That yeveth hem ful ofte in many a gyse
Thow maist to thy desir somtyme atteyne.
Wolde han suffised right ynough for me.
He seyde, "Allas that day that I was born!
In any contree of this Theseus,
And hadde hym knowe at Thebes yeer by yere,
Syn thilke day that they were children lite,
Love, if thee list, for I love and ay shal;
To stonden in hir grace; namoore shal I;
Wostow nat wel the olde clerkes sawe,
"Thow shalt," quod he, "be rather fals than I;
To love my lady, whom I love and serve,
That nevere, for to dyen in the peyne,
This Palamon, whan he tho wordes herde,
Wher as this lady romed to and fro,
And therwithal on knees doun he fil,
"Cosyn, for sothe, of this opinioun
Why cridestow? Who hath thee doon offence?
That he was born, ful ofte he seyde, "allas!"
And Palamoun, this woful prisoner,
She gadereth floures, party white and rede,
The sesoun priketh every gentil herte,
This passeth yeer by yeer and day by day,
To Atthenes, to dwellen in prisoun
Of whiche two Arcita highte that oon,
Stille in that feeld he took al nyght his reste,
To doon obsequies, as was tho the gyse.
Til that he cam to Thebes and alighte
Unto the toun of Atthenes to dwelle,
How Creon was of Theseus yserved
With herte pitous, whan he herde them speke.
Of alle oure lordes whiche that been yslawe,
That starf at Thebes -- cursed be that day! --
That she ne hath been a duchesse or a queene.
Whan she hadde swowned with a deedly cheere,
And of this cry they nolde nevere stenten
This duc, of whom I make mencioun,
And of the feste that was at hir weddynge,
Lete I this noble duc to Atthenes ryde,
That gretter was ther noon under the sonne.
He is his thral to whom that he hath sayd
Dissimule as thou were deef, if that thou heere
Comth muchel harm; thus was me toold and taught.
But for litel speche avysely
But nathelees, thus taughte me my dame:
Unto the devel, which I hym bitake;
Ne nevere in al thy lif ne shaltou speke.
Er ye doon any execucion
Ful giltelees, that dorste I swere, ywys!
For sorwe of which he brak his mynstralcie,
What wol ye moore? The crowe anon hym tolde,
To heere thy voys? Allas, what song is this?"
I wol go to my tale, as I bigan.
That, for the tirant is of gretter myght
But that the gentile, in estaat above,
The wise Plato seith, as ye may rede,
Deceyved was, for al his jolitee.
Alle thise ensamples speke I by thise men
And lat hym seen a mous go by the wal,
And keep it al so clenly as thou may,
To plesen hire, wenynge for swich plesaunce,
But al in ydel, for it availleth noght.
Ne koude, by an hondred thousand deel,
For his desport, in signe eek of victorie
That with his syngyng walled that citee,
He was the mooste lusty bachiler
T' acord and love, and many a wrong apese.
Of this vessel the Cook drank faste, allas!
Yet hadde I levere payen for the mare
Telle on thy tale; of hym make I no fors.
Upon this man, by my savacioun,
For lakke of speche, and doun the hors hym caste,
The devel of helle sette his foot therin!
And that oure Hoost wole, of his curteisye,
Or hastow with som quene al nyght yswonke,
A theef myghte hym ful lightly robbe and bynde.
Ne phislyas, ne termes queinte of lawe.
Seyde the Shipman, "Heer schal he nat preche;
Can moche good, by Goddes dignitee!"
Now Jhesu Crist, that of his myght may sende
And fyndeth hire freendes hoole and sounde;
That litel while in joye or in plesance
To Engelond been they come the righte way,
A thousand foold wel moore than I kan telle.
Was put allone and dampned for to dye.
The morwe cam, and Alla gan hym dresse,
As he that is of Cristen folk the flour,
In relief of hir longe, pitous pyne,
I may nat telle hir wo until to-morwe,
"Now God," quod he, "and his halwes brighte
Unnethe upon hir feet she myghte stonde.
And afterward he made his argument:
Now was this child as lyk unto Custance
A mooder he hath, but fader hath he noon
This senatour hath lad this child to feeste;
As wel to shewen his heighe magnificence
That, if I shortly tellen shal and playn,
In hooly werkes evere, as was hir grace.
In which Custance sit ful pitously.
For which this Emperour hath sent anon
Til Cristes mooder -- blessed be she ay! --
To sleen hym Olofernus in his tente,
That noght for werk somtyme, but for th' entente
But blisful Marie heelp hire right anon;
In point to spille, as I shal telle yow soone.
But now wol I unto Custance go,
The hand was knowe that the lettre wroot,
And pleynly al the manere he hym tolde
Habundantly for hire ful longe space,
And if thou darst nat saven hym, for blame,
Now, lady bright, to whom alle woful cryen,
And into hevene hire eyen up she caste.
In salte see, althogh I se noght how.
Wepen bothe yonge and olde in al that place
Ful ofte he seyde, "Allas and weylaway!"
Hire, and hir yonge sone, and al hir geere,
He slepeth, and he fnorteth in his gyse
And therfore to the feend I thee resigne;
And forth he gooth; ther is na moore to doone.
"Welcome the sonde of Crist for everemoore
The lettre spak the queene delivered was
Donegild answerde, "As now at this tyme, nay;
Unto the kynges mooder rideth swithe,
So longe is goon with childe, til that stille
They moste take in pacience at nyght
So strange a creature unto his make.
And after this Jhesus, of his mercy,
Greet was the drede and eek the repentance
That doun he fil atones as a stoon,
As gentil herte is fulfild of pitee,
Amonges alle the faces in that route?
Fro false blame, and thou, merciful mayde,
Depper in this, a trouthe for to lere.
Berth hire on hond that she hath doon thys thyng.
To kyng Alla was toold al this meschance,
And kitte the throte of Hermengyld atwo,
She wolde do no synne, by no weye.
Agayn the Scottes, as men may wel heere;
Custance answerde, "Sire, it is Cristes myght,
Croked and oold, with eyen faste yshette.
And ny the castel swiche ther dwelten three.
In al that lond no Cristen dorste route;
She was so diligent, withouten slouthe,
But algates therby was she understonde.
That thennes wolde it noght of al a tyde;
Who fedde the Egipcien Marie in the cave,
With drye feet thurghout the see passynge.
By certeine meenes ofte, as knowen clerkis,
Men myghten asken why she was nat slayn
Flemere of feendes out of hym and here
Unto the croys of Crist thus seyde she:
They han hir set, and bidde hire lerne saille
Been al tohewe and stiked at the bord,
But al to deere they boghte it er they ryse.
And thus in murthe and joye I lete hem dwelle;
Noght trowe I the triumphe of Julius,
And seyde his wyf was comen, out of doute,
That she moste han the Cristen folk to feeste --
Thyn instrument so -- weylawey the while! --
O serpent under femynynytee,
And to hem alle she spak right in this wyse:
For we reneyed Mahoun oure creance?
"Lordes," quod she, "ye knowen everichon,
She peyneth hire to make good contenance;
Was ther no philosophre in al thy toun?
At the bigynnyng of this fiers viage,
N' at Rome, for the harm thurgh Hanybal
Ne shal I nevere seen yow moore with ye.
And to be bounden under subjeccioun
The day is comen of hir departynge;
Wel may men knowen that so greet ordinance
And alle his liges sholde ycristned be,
To geten hire that hath my lyf in cure,
By cause that ther was swich diversitee
To shapen for his lyf som remedye.
The strif of Thebes; and of Ercules,
Paraventure in thilke large book
Make hem good chiere, and bisily espye
But now to purpos lat us turne agayn.
I prey to God in honour hire susteene,
And so bifel that th' excellent renoun
With hem, and eek to sellen hem hire ware.
I were right now of tales desolaat,
And alle thy freendes fleen from thee, allas!
Whan that his tayl shal brennen in the gleede,
To asken help thee shameth in thyn herte;
To Muses that men clepe Pierides --
How that the cursed kyng Antiochus
The crueltee of the, queene Medea,
Ther may he seen the large woundes wyde
In o book, he hath seyd hem in another.
Al my biheste, I kan no bettre sayn.
Lat us nat mowlen thus in ydelnesse.
And what thurgh necligence in oure wakynge,
Degrees was fyve and fourty clombe on highte,
The ark of his artificial day hath ronne
For and I sholde rekenen every vice
Been they, us sely men for to deceyve,
He kisseth hire and clippeth hire ful ofte,
First whan his sighte is newe come ageyn,
But, by my fader soule, I wende han seyn
Ye han som glymsyng, and no parfit sighte."
Was no thyng bet, to make yow to see,
But if I wolde speke uncurteisly;
Gan pullen up the smok, and in he throng.
For wel I woot that ye mystruste me,
To eten of the smale peres grene.
"Yow love I best, and shal, and oother noon."
That I wolde graunten hym his sighte ageyn,
I sette right noght, of al the vileynye
What though he made a temple, Goddes hous?
With martirdom they preved hire constance.
Yit shul we wommen visage it hardily,
Bothe in repreve of hire and othere mo."
So falle upon youre bodyes yet to-nyght!
Fulfild of sapience and of worldly glorie,
How in his grisely carte he hire fette --
But litel fro his declynacion
And every signe that she koude make,
Why speke ye thus? But men been evere untrewe,
Wherfore I wole answere in this manere,
For verray love; this is withouten doute.
I yeve it yow, maketh chartres as yow leste;
Levere ich hadde to dyen on a knyf
And in he stirte, and that in swich manere
The gardyn is enclosed al aboute;
Were passed [of] the month of [Juyn], bifil
Som wonder by this clyket shal bityde,
Yet was he blent, and, God woot, so been mo
That hadde an hand upon hire everemo.
That loveth Damyan so benyngnely
For whan he wiste it may noon oother be,
And therwithal the fyr of jalousie,
Thy yiftes under hewe of stidefastnesse,
And in this wyse, many a murye day,
Swich deyntee hath in it to walke and pleye,
Ne koude of it the beautee wel devyse;
This noble Januarie, with al his myght,
And eek to Januarie he gooth as lowe
And sotilly this lettre doun she threste
And hem rejoysen in hire crueel pryde,
I rekke noght, for heere I hym assure
To any womman for to gete hire love,
How that he wroghte, I dar nat to yow telle,
She rente it al to cloutes atte laste,
For I am deed if that this thyng be kyd."
With alle hir wommen unto Damyan.
That alle ye go se this Damyan.
But after mete, as soone as evere I may,
Excused hym by cause of his siknesse,
The fourthe day compleet fro noon to noon,
And in a purs of sylk heng on his sherte
Eek if thou speke, she wol thy wo biwreye.
Or elles longe may he nat endure;
In his nyght-cappe, and with his nekke lene;
And thanne he taketh a sop in fyn clarree,
That may bothe werke wel and hastily;
He lulleth hire; he kisseth hire ful ofte;
And to his privee freendes thus seyde he:
Where as they doon hir thynges as hem leste,
For in this world nys worse pestilence
O perilous fyr, that in the bedstraw bredeth!
Which carf biforn the knyght ful many a day.
And that the nyght wolde lasten everemo.
That he that nyght in armes wolde hire streyne
Hire to biholde it semed fayerye.
That writest us that ilke weddyng murie
And Venus laugheth upon every wight,
And ful of instrumentz and of vitaille,
Forth comth the preest, with stole aboute his nekke,
That she, this mayden which that Mayus highte,
Beth nat agast herof, my brother deere,
Swifter than dooth an arwe out of a bowe.
Ye may repente of wedded mannes lyf,
This is my drede, and ye, my bretheren tweye,
And so greet ese and lust in mariage
For thanne, he seyde, his spirit was at ese.
He seyde ther was a mayden in the toun,
That hastily they wolden to hym come;
Hir wise governaunce, hir gentillesse,
And somme were riche and hadden badde name.
And sette it in a commune market-place,
"That letteth matrimoigne, sikerly."
This is to seyn, to doon hire ful plesaunce.
But I woot best where wryngeth me my sho.
And al this axeth leyser for t' enquere.
Wher she be wys, or sobre, or dronkelewe,
Senek, amonges othere wordes wyse,
And trewely, it is an heigh corage
That dar presume, or elles thenken it,
And God it woot, though I unworthy be,
To weyven fro the word of Salomon.
As al day falleth altercacioun
And blosmy tree nys neither drye ne deed.
Or for that ech of hem sholde helpen oother
Ther speketh many a man of mariage
For if so were I hadde swich myschaunce
And eek thise olde wydwes, God it woot,
Ye shullen rather swich a thyng espyen
I have my body folily despended;
For which this Januarie, of whom I tolde,
I warne thee, if wisely thou wolt wirche,
The peple of God, and made hym Mardochee
By good conseil of his mooder Rebekke,
Or elles preye to God hym for to sende
She kepeth his good, and wasteth never a deel;
So buxom and so vertuous is she,
And herke why -- I sey nat this for noght --
As londes, rentes, pasture, or commune,
Wol kepe thee bet than she that waiteth ay
And yet somme clerkes seyn it nys nat so,
Ther as a wedded man in his estaat
And lede his lyf in joye and in solas,
"Noon oother lyf," seyde he, "is worth a bene,
Were it for hoolynesse or for dotage
For soory herte, I telle may namoore."
Thise monthes two, and moore nat, pardee;
Bitwix Grisildis grete pacience
I knowe ynogh, on even and a-morwe,"
They seyde, "The man is wood, my leeve brother";
And that he preyed hem, for Goddes love,
That yet aswowne lay, bothe pale and wan,
And thoughte, "Allas, now comth Nowelis flood!"
That with the strook he was almoost yblent;
This Nicholas was risen for to pisse,
He cogheth first, and knokketh therwithal
And I wol brynge it thee agayn ful soone."
Why rise ye so rathe? Ey, benedicitee!
Ful ofte paramours he gan deffie,
With dust, with sond, with straw, with clooth, with chippes,
He felte a thyng al rough and long yherd,
"Have do," quod she, "com of, and speed the faste,
"Wiltow thanne go thy wey therwith?" quod she.
"Go fro the wyndow, Jakke fool," she sayde;
"What do ye, hony-comb, sweete Alisoun,
Up rist this joly lovere Absolon,
To Alison now wol I tellen al
And dwellen at the grange a day or two;
That is for love alwey so wo bigon,
Doun of the laddre stalketh Nicholay,
"Now, Pater-noster, clom!" seyde Nicholay,
With breed, and chese, and good ale in a jubbe,
He wepeth, weyleth, maketh sory cheere;
Help us to scape, or we been dede echon!
Men seyn thus, `sende the wise, and sey no thyng.'
For it is Goddes owene heeste deere.
Be myrie, for the flood wol passe anon.'
And hast oure vitaille faire in hem yleyd,
I wol nat tellen Goddes pryvetee.
A knedyng trogh, or ellis a kymelyn,
"Hastou nat herd," quod Nicholas, "also
Thou mayst nat werken after thyn owene heed;
That half so greet was nevere Noes flood.
"Nay, Crist forbede it, for his hooly blood!"
And whan that ech of hem had dronke his part,
Gan for to sik soore, and seyde, "Allas!
Awak, and thenk on Cristes passioun!
And to the chambre dore he gan hym dresse.
He walked in the feeldes for to prye
This carpenter to blessen hym bigan,
How may ye slepen al the longe day?"
This world is now ful tikel, sikerly.
He nolde answere for thyng that myghte falle.
And right anon, withouten wordes mo,
For Absolon may waille and synge "allas."
He ne hadde for his labour but a scorn.
He sente hire pyment, meeth, and spiced ale,
And she answerde hir housbonde therwithal,
And dressed hym up by a shot-wyndowe
This parissh clerk, this joly Absolon,
Of fartyng, and of speche daungerous.
In twenty manere koude he trippe and daunce
With Poules wyndow corven on his shoos,
Cristes owene werkes for to wirche,
"Nay, therof care thee noght," quod Nicholas.
This Nicholas gan mercy for to crye,
For deerne love of thee, lemman, I spille."
She was a prymerole, a piggesnye,
As any swalwe sittynge on a berne.
Than is the newe pere-jonette tree,
Whit was hir smok, and broyden al bifoore
That bad man sholde wedde his simylitude.
Ful often blessed was his myrie throte.
His Almageste, and bookes grete and smale,
Of every thyng; I may nat rekene hem alle.
A riche gnof, that gestes heeld to bord,
Of storial thyng that toucheth gentillesse,
But tolde his cherles tale in his manere.
Yet nolde I, for the oxen in my plogh,
Thou mayst ynogh of othere thynges seyn."
And therfore if that I mysspeke or seye,
And seyde, "Abyd, Robyn, my leeve brother;
Somwhat to quite with the Knyghtes tale."
Whan that the Knyght had thus his tale ytoold,
His doghter, which that called was Phanye.
Which that he knew in heigh sentence habounde,
Swich hap that he escaped thurgh the rayn,
Of which Cresus Cirus soore hym dradde,
Lucan, to thee this storie I recomende,
But nevere gronte he at no strook but oon,
Ful prively hath maad conspiracye
Of Rome, which that fleigh at this bataille.
O myghty Cesar, that in Thessalie
The whiche two of al this wo I wyte?
Empoysoned of thyn owene folk thou weere;
Whiche he conquered, and broghte hem into wo?
Bitwixe hym and another conquerour;
De Alexandro
In this meschief he wayled and eek wepte,
That it his limes and his skyn totar,
That in his guttes carf it so and boot
And for that Nichanore and Thymothee
And why he fil fro heigh prosperitee,
Slepynge, his heed of smoot, and from his tente
"Nabugodonosor was god," seyde hee;
That regnes mo putte in subjeccioun,
And in this gardyn foond he cherles tweye
Tho wiste he wel, he hadde himself mysgyed,
To sette a man that is fulfild of vice
Which afterward hym thoughte a greet grevaunce;
This Seneca, of which that I devyse,
Whan myght is joyned unto crueltee,
His mooder made he in pitous array,
That ilke clooth that he hadde wered o day,
Although that Nero were as vicius
And after that, within a day or two,
And when the woeful father saw him dead,
When will the jailer bring our soup?
And on a day befell that in that hour
Alas, Fortune, it was great cruelty
For he was thy nephew and son-in-law,
And for no thing but for thy chivalry
The wicked nest was worker of this violent act.
Whom Fortune held so high in majesty,
Alas, Fortune! She that formerly was
And put her in fetters, and also her two children,
But always Fortune has bitterness in her honey;
Dared never be so courageous
When Odenake was dead, she mightily
Nor never could their foemen make them flee,
To have of various tongues full knowing,
But now unto our tale we turn.
And if she were with childe at that time,
They lived in joy and in felicity,
With any young man, were he never so strong.
And many a wild hart's blood she shed
Zenobia, of Palmyra queen,
Though for this he had neither right nor law.
Drank of the same vessels various wines;
Until he knew, by grace and by reason,
Who could explain what this text meant;
For the honor that our elders left with us."
His high estate made him confident in pride;
He thanked God, and always in his life in fear
Could not deprive him of his estate.
This proud king had made a statue of gold,
At Babylon was his sovereign throne,
Be wary, for when Fortune wants to deceive,
But on his back all naked he wore this shirt
Who was called Dianira, fresh as May;
And long bore the heaven on his neck.
He slew the Harpies, the fierce cruel birds;
Beth war by this ensample oold and playn
And made hym as hire fool biforn hem pleye;
But er his heer were clipped or yshave,
But soone shal he wepe many a teere,
Hye on an hill whereas men myghte hem see.
That God wolde on his peyne han some pitee
Thre hundred foxes took Sampson for ire,
But to his wyves toolde he his secree,
Hadde nevere worldly man so heigh degree
For though Fortune may noon angel dere,
I wol biwaille in manere of tragedie
Lo, this declaryng oghte ynogh suffise.
Of whiche I have an hundred in my celle.
God woot, no lussheburghes payen ye!
Though he were shorn ful hye upon his pan,
A wel farynge persone for the nones.
I vowe to God, thou hast a ful fair skyn;
That shal he fynde that hire mysdooth or seith --
Thou darst nat stonden by thy wyves right!'
Wol nat in chirche to my wyf enclyne,
And by that precious corpus Madrian,
Sire Pardoner, be glad and myrie of cheere;
In stide of relikes or of seintuarie.
Com forth, sire Hoost, and offre first anon,
T' assoille yow in contree as ye ryde,
If any of yow wole, of devocion,
I yow assoille, by myn heigh power,
Thou art so fals and so unkynde, allas?
Thus ended been thise homycides two,
"Now lat us sitte and drynke, and make us merie,
The thridde he kepte clene for his drynke.
Noght but the montance of a corn of whete,
And preyde hym that he hym wolde selle
Of God that sholde lyve so murye as I!"
Thanne may we bothe oure lustes all fulfille,
That, by my trouthe, I wol thee nat biwreye."
But nathelees, if I kan shape it so
And bad hem drawe and looke where it wol falle;
Wherfore I rede that cut among us alle
To-day that we sholde han so fair a grace?
But ech of hem so glad was of that sighte,
Under a tree, and there he wole abyde;
Thou spak right now of thilke traytour Deeth.
`Agayns an oold man, hoor upon his heed,
Allas, whan shul my bones been at reste?

"Is it swich peril with hym for to meete?
Beth redy for to meete hym everemoore;
And sodeynly he was yslayn to-nyght,

Lo, rather he forbedeth swich sweryng

O, wiste a man how manye maladyes

That it is grisly for to heere hem swere.
In Flaundres whilom was a compaignye
But herkneth, lordynges, in conclusioun:

Of this mateere it oghte ynogh suffise.
I preche of no thyng but for coveityse.
In prechyng, so that he shal nat asterte
And nothyng for correccioun of synne.

And in Latyn I speke a wordes fewe,

Or elles a draughte of moyste and corny ale,
And eek thyne urynals and thy jurdones,

And bade oure Hoost he sholde to hym seye
"But nathelees, this meditacioun
And therfore, if yow list -- I wol nat glose --
Why sholde I sowen draf out of my fest,
For every man, save thou, hath toold his tale.
Seyde in this wise: "Lordynges everichoon,
Foure of the clokke it was tho, as I gesse,
